<p class="drop-cap">THE PROFESSOR was pottering about his
laboratory. He called it a laboratory, this
work-room down in New Jersey, where he
was peacefully ending his days, but it was not such
in the ordinary acceptation of the term. The brightly
burning lights shone on no apparatus for distilling
evil-smelling gases, no glass retorts, no long lines of
bottles. What instruments it disclosed were of a
kind more likely to appeal to a sailor than to a
chemist, though many of them would probably have
seemed odd to both. A lead-line with “marks” and
“deeps,” various scoop nets, a long sectional aquarium
in which various sea creatures moved, barometers,
anemometers, and other “meters” for measuring
winds and waters, a great globe, and piles of
charts, were some of the articles the room contained,
for this was the workshop of Professor Shishkin, the
great Russian physicist, member of scores of learned
societies, and the ultimate authority on the waves,
winds, currents, flora, and fauna of the ocean.</p>

<p>The Professor had come to America about twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
years before, bringing with him a young daughter,
a working knowledge of the English language, and
a profound acquaintance with the ocean. He had
secured a post in a small school, from which he had
gone from one college to another, all the while growing
in reputation until he came to be probably the
best known physicist in the world. When he came to
America, he was apparently about fifty years of age,
but where and how he had passed those fifty years
he never told. Obviously, he must have been a
student if not a professor, and it seemed strange
that one with his attainments could have lived for
half a century unnoticed; yet of his early life no
trace was to be had. His name did not appear on
the rolls of any of the great European universities;
and even after he grew to distinction, no alma mater
claimed him for her own. Deliberately he had cut
himself off from his early life. To him, the past was
dead.</p>

<p>But the past is never really dead. Its beginnings
are untraceable, and its ending must ever be unknown.
Men put their finger on some turning point
in their lives and say, “Here this began,” or, “Here
that ended.” Wrong in both assertions! The beginning
began long before, and the ending will not end
even when R.I.P. is graven on their tombstones. At
the very moment when Professor Shishkin was congratulating
himself on the peaceful afternoon of his
life, strenuous fate was on its way in the darkness
of that March evening to call him again to action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>The avatar of fate was one who would attract
attention even in New York, that melting pot of the
nations. Carelessly dressed, dark, with high cheek-bones
and glowing eyes, even the casual might pronounce
him a fanatic who was living on his nerves
and declare that some day the nerves would burn
out and the man collapse.</p>

<p>At the door he gave his name to Olga Shishkin,
the Professor’s daughter, now grown to womanhood,
and she took it to the Professor in his laboratory.</p>

<p>The Professor was puzzled. “Maxime Gorloff,”
he repeated doubtfully. “I don’t recall the name.
Did he say what he wanted, Olga?”</p>

<p>Olga shook her head. “No,” she answered.
“Only that he wanted to see the distinguished
Professor. He seemed very much in earnest. He
speaks English well, but with an accent. I think he
must be an immigrant.”</p>

<p>“An immigrant! Eh?” The Professor did not
measure men by the price of their steamer passages.
“Well, show him in. I am always glad to talk with
strangers, especially if they are very much in earnest.
They usually have a new point of view and can teach
me something. Show him in.”</p>

<p>The man came in. If a shade of disappointment
crossed his face as he noted the Professor’s white
hair and wasted limbs, it disappeared as he returned
the latter’s courteous greeting. “I have come many
miles to see you, Professor,” he declared quietly, as
he took the chair proffered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“So!” The Professor preened himself with harmless
vanity. People often came many miles to see
and consult him. “Many miles!” he repeated.
“That means so different a thing to-day than it did
when I was young. Fifty miles were very many in
those days.”</p>

<p>The man Maxime nodded understandingly. “And
four thousand is many to-day; yes! Moscow is four
thousand miles away.”</p>

<p>“You come from Moscow?” The Professor’s
tone expressed only polite interest. Moscow was
indeed very far from him, mentally as well as geographically.</p>

<p>“Yes, from Moscow! From the House of the
Seven Feathers—Brother.”</p>

<p>The Professor sat rigid, the smile fading slowly
from his lips. His hands slowly tightened on the
arms of his chair until the knuckles showed white.
“I—I—did not catch—that is, what—the House of
the Seven Feathers, did you say?”</p>

<p>Pity showed in the young man’s eyes, but he did
not waver. “Yes, I said that—Brother,” he reiterated.</p>

<p>“I—I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>Maxime leaned forward. “What shall I say to
remind you?” he asked. “Shall I recite the oath of
brotherhood or call the names of the Defenders of
the Cause? Shall I adjure you by fire or steel or
rope? I come from the House of the Seven Feathers,
Brother. Make answer!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>The Professor’s dry lips moved. “What is their
color, Brother?” he asked, the words dropping unwillingly
from his lips.</p>

<p>“Red!” The man touched his hand to his forehead.</p>

<p>“May they prosper!” The Professor stroked
his beard. The first shock was past, and the words
came easier. After all, the visit could portend little.
He was too old. “Very well,” he said. “I acknowledge
the call. What will you?”</p>

<p>“The Brotherhood has need of you.”</p>

<p>“The Brotherhood has no longer a claim on me.
I did it good service once. I gave it my youth and
my early manhood, and I paid for it to the full.
That was twenty years ago. For twenty years I have
had no intercourse with it. My obligation is ended.”</p>

<p>“So long as fire burns and water flows; so long
as steel cuts and grass grows; till death and after it,”
quoted the other softly.</p>

<p>“But I am no longer a Russian; I am an American
citizen.”</p>

<p>“Adoption does not free a man from his mother’s
call. Your long exemption only adds to your obligation.”</p>

<p>The Professor moved uneasily in his chair. Fear
was growing on him, but he tried to shake it off. “I
am not in sympathy with the present aims of the
Brotherhood,” he protested. “I have lived too long
in the outer world. No cause was ever helped by
murder. Besides, Russia is not fitted for self-government.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>Maxime shrugged his shoulders. “We will not
discuss it,” he declared. “The Brotherhood calls
you. Will you obey, or must I first remind you of
what it did for you twenty years ago, just before you
fled secretly by night from the palace of the Grand
Duke in St. Petersburg, bearing in your arms——”</p>

<p>“Stop! Stop!”</p>

<p>But the man went on pitilessly. “Twenty years
ago,” he said, as one repeating a lesson, “you were
known by the name of Lladislas Metrovitch. You
were a subordinate member of the Brotherhood, and
rendered it good though not material service. You
were married twice, the second time to an American
lady who had been the governess of your nieces. You
had one child by her. You were well known for your
scientific attainments. One day you were arrested,
charged with sedition. You disappeared. Your
property was confiscated, your household scattered.</p>

<p>“Three years went by, during which you rotted
in the dungeons of the fortress of St. Peter and St.
Paul. Then, by the aid of the Brotherhood, you
escaped—old before your time, broken, feeble. You
sought for your wife, your family. You could learn
little of them. At last you heard that your wife was
dead, and that her child and yours was being brought
up in the household of the Grand Duke Ivan. You
did not dare to claim the child openly, but, aided
by the Brotherhood, you stole her and escaped with
her to America.”</p>

<p>The Professor raised his head. His shoulders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
shook. The forgotten horror of those by-gone days
had all come back as if it had been but yesterday.
He was about to speak when the man interposed.</p>

<p>“I have more to tell,” he said. “When you fled
from Russia you thought your wife was dead. You
were deceived. She did not die until about a year
ago.”</p>

<p>“Not dead! Not dead!” The Professor’s face
flushed red, then changed to a ghastly pallor. “Not
dead!” he muttered.</p>

<p>“No, not dead!” The worst was over, and the
man hurried on. “There was much connected with
your arrest that you did not know. You believed
that it was due to your association with the Brotherhood.
You were wrong. You were arrested because
the Grand Duke Ivan admired your wife.”</p>

<p>The Professor’s shoulders shook, but he said no
word. Age dulls the capacity to feel; cools the passions
as well as the affections. The old man had
borne much; no further shock could greatly move
him.</p>

<p>“You disappeared. Ivan was kind to your wife,
but declared that your arrest had been ordered by
the Emperor himself, and that he could do nothing.
Soon you were reported dead. Not long after he
married her—morganatically, of course. She is not
to be too much blamed. She was penniless, alone, in
a strange land, with a child to support. She married
him. When you stole your child you stole it from
her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>The Professor’s dry lips moved. “I did not
know,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“No, you did not know. The fault was not yours,
but that of the system we are trying to destroy. So
much for the past! Now for the future. Will you
obey the orders of the Brotherhood?”</p>

<p>Maxime’s voice dropped, and he sat silent, watching
the older man dumbly fighting through the shock.
Pity was in his eyes, but relentlessness was there
also—the relentlessness of the priest who pities the
victim, but does not drop the sacrificial knife.
Patiently he waited for the other to speak.</p>

<p>At last the words came, and Maxime’s face flushed
with triumph as he heard them.</p>

<p>“What does the Brotherhood require?” the Professor
asked hollowly.</p>

<p>The younger man stretched out his hand to the
great globe that stood beside him and twirled it on
its axis. “In March, just two years ago,” he began,
“the ship <i>Orkney</i> sailed from London for St. Petersburg
with five millions in gold on board, consigned
to the Russian government. It was the people’s
gold, borrowed on the people’s credit, to aid in enslaving
the people. We swore it should never reach
St. Petersburg. We kept our word. The <i>Orkney</i>
was wrecked in the night in the Gulf of Bothnia—no
one survived to tell where. Russia long sought for
it in vain. We ourselves sought for it in vain. But
now, at last, a clue has reached our hands.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“It is not perfect yet, but it will be. Marie Fitzhugh,
our agent, will be here in a few hours, and will
forge the last links. Her task is difficult, but she
will succeed. By one means or another, she will
succeed. I would have waited till she had finished
her part before seeing you, but I have been ordered
to another duty and must leave to-night. So she
herself will send you word—perhaps to-morrow.
If not to-morrow, soon after.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“If she succeeds, we shall be able to go to the spot
and get the gold. If she fails, we nevertheless shall
know approximately where to look for it. But, as
you are aware, no vessel can dredge in the Baltic
without being watched. We do not want to find the
gold for Russia to seize. So we come to you for help.”</p>

<p>“What?” Amazement showed in Professor Shishkin’s
face and voice. “Are you serious?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Why not? You have spent a lifetime studying
the sea. You have made a specialty of the Baltic.
You have won a great name by your work there.
What more natural then than that you should revisit
your chosen field? What more natural than that
you should take divers with you to explore the sea-bottom?
You, and you alone, of all the Brotherhood,
can do this without suspicion. You, and you alone,
can get the gold safely on board after it is found.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“There are no buts when the Brotherhood speaks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
and it has spoken. If the task be difficult, the more
honor in accomplishing it. A ship will be provided,
manned, and equipped. Your sole duty is to prepare
such apparatus as you may need for your scientific
work, and to spread abroad the alleged object
of your trip. Probably you had better send an announcement
of it to the newspapers. Of course you
will not do this until Marie notifies you.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“One thing more,” went on the messenger,
gravely. “I am instructed to command you to take
your daughter with you. Her presence will add
force to your declaration that the trip is purely
scientific.”</p>

<p>The Professor shook his head. “I cannot do it,”
he declared. “I cannot and will not take Olga to
Russia, under any circumstances. You know why.”</p>

<p>“The Brotherhood commands it.”</p>

<p>“I will appeal.”</p>

<p>“There is no appeal, as you know.”</p>

<p>“Then I refuse.”</p>

<p>The man sprang to his feet. “Refuse, do you?”
he cried, in a sibilant hiss that seemed to fill the
room. “Refuse? Have you forgotten the penalty
of disobedience? Have you forgotten the oath you
took?—‘If I fail in obedience, may I be cut off, I
and my children and my children’s children, and
my name live no more forever.’ Do you remember,
Professor Shishkin?”</p>

<p>The man paused, and his voice changed. “Believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
me, I am sorry,” he murmured; “but I, like yourself,
am a subordinate. It is the Brotherhood that speaks,
not I. And the Brotherhood speaks for the people—do
not forget that—speaks for the great, inarticulate
Russian people, struggling to burst their age-long
shackles. While we sit here, men are sacrificing
their lives and women their honor for the cause.
Who are you to hold back? No harm will come to
your daughter, but even if the risk were ten times
greater, still she must take it. You and she both
owe it to Russia.” He paused. “What shall I say
to the Brotherhood?” he demanded.</p>

<p>The old man bowed his head. “I will obey,” he
muttered. “I must obey. I have no choice.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWO</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ALSTON CARUTH lived in the Chimneystack
Building. When he returned to his apartments
at midnight on the day of Gorloff’s
visit to Professor Shishkin, he found Marie Fitzhugh,
agent of the Brotherhood, awaiting him. She
had risen at the sound of his key in the lock, and
stood facing him, externally cool and self-possessed,
but with apprehension shining in her soft dark eyes.
Her fingers trembled as they rested on the edge of
the table, and her color came and went. A close
observer would have said that she was frightened
half to death.</p>

<p>Caruth, however, was not a close observer; at
least, not at that moment. Amazement showed in
his eyes as he snatched off his hat and whipped the
cigarette from his parting lips. His fresh young
face, flushed from the gaiety of the evening, looked
almost boyish in its confusion.</p>

<p>His obvious embarrassment seemed to restore the
girl’s balance. “Mr. Caruth?” she inquired, with
a slight movement of her head.</p>

<p>Caruth nodded. For the moment he was beyond
words. Her soft, musical voice and air of refinement
impressed him, despite the unconventionality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
of her presence in his rooms at that time of the night,
and his attitude became even more respectful.
“Yes,” he stammered; “I am Mr. Caruth. What
can I do for you?”</p>

<p>“I am Miss Fitzhugh. I have come four thousand
miles to talk with you, Mr. Caruth. Your valet was
kind enough to let me wait, though he was clearly
horrified by my desiring to do so. Will you not sit
down?”</p>

<p>Caruth hesitated. Of medium build, clean-shaven,
correctly dressed, he might have stepped out of a
Gibson drawing. Every detail was present, even to
the strong chin and the firm mouth.</p>

<p>“It is late,” he suggested, glancing at the clock,
the hands of which stood straight upward. “I am at
your service, of course, but perhaps to-morrow——”</p>

<p>The girl smiled, a trifle wearily. “One does not
come four thousand miles for a trifle,” she answered.
“The convenances must yield to necessity. I must
talk with you to-night.”</p>

<p>Caruth bowed and seated himself across the centre
table from her. Though his surprise had not abated,
he was rapidly regaining his self-possession, and as
the girl resumed her own chair, he leaned forward a
little, studying her thoughtfully, noting the anxious
lines about her youthful eyes and mouth.</p>

<p>Although her English had been excellent, she did
not impress him as being of American nor yet of
English birth. An alien air clung intangibly about
her and about her costume, which, even to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
masculine intelligence, bespoke the work of a dress-maker
of more than ordinary skill.</p>

<p>She was plainly a lady. Had it not been too
amazing, he would have guessed that she must be a
person of distinction in her own land—wherever
that might be. That she was beautiful seemed
somehow not surprising; that she was very young
did. What could such a woman be doing alone in
his bachelor rooms at that hour of the night.</p>

<p>Disguising his wonder, he sought to carry off the
situation. “You are tired?” he questioned gently.
“I’m afraid I kept you waiting a long time. I’m
sorry. I didn’t know. Can’t I offer you something
to eat or drink, Miss Fitzhugh?”</p>

<p>Slowly the girl nodded. “I’m glad,” she breathed,
half to herself. “They told me American men were
like this, but I could scarcely believe it. In Europe
it would have been very different. I am proud of
my half-cousins.” She paused; then answered his
question. “Thank you,” she said. “I will take a
glass of sherry and a biscuit.”</p>

<p>Caruth touched the bell. “Sherry and crackers,
Wilkins,” he ordered briefly.</p>

<p>Not until the tray had been set before them, and
the valet had gone, did either of them speak again.
Caruth was slowly awakening to the fact that the
beauty of the woman before him was not ordinary.
It was not alone the perfection of her features that
appealed to him. Every detail about her was artistically
perfect. Her coloring, the poise of her head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the slim roundness of her taper fingers, the iridescent
gleam of her brown hair beneath her wide hat—all
satisfied his somewhat critical taste.</p>

<p>Suddenly he realized that he was staring, and,
dropping his eyes, he forced himself to speak casually.
“Your half-cousins?” he queried, answering
her lead. “You are, then——”</p>

<p>“American? Yes! On my mother’s side, but my
father is Russian, and I have never been in America
until to-night. I like it, Mr. Caruth,” she ended—“what
I have seen of it. It rests with you to confirm
my opinion.”</p>

<p>Caruth questioned her with his eyes. “Yes?” he
answered politely. “I hope I shall be able to do so.”</p>

<p>For a moment the girl did not speak. Her bosom
rose and fell a trifle faster. She crumbled her cracker
nervously, and her hand shook slightly as she lifted
her glass. Caruth, silent, attentive, awaited her
pleasure.</p>

<p>“Ten days ago,” she said, at last, “a letter was
mailed to you at Stockholm in Sweden. It was not
intended for you. It was sent to you by mistake—a
mistake realized within a few hours after it had
been posted. An effort was made to recover it, but
it had already started on its way. Its progress has
been traced carefully. It left Brest on the steamship
<i>Latourette</i>, which reached quarantine here at
eight o’clock to-night. It may be delivered to you
at any moment.”</p>

<p>Caruth glanced at the clock and smiled. “I fear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
you are mistaken,” he objected. “Even if this letter
reached the post-office to-night—which seems to me
doubtful—it will not be delivered until to-morrow—unless,
of course, it has a quick delivery stamp on it.”</p>

<p>The girl nodded. “It has a quick delivery stamp
on it,” she rejoined promptly; “and if I understand
your post-office methods, it will be delivered very
soon. The mail-bags left the ship when I did.”</p>

<p>“You crossed on the same vessel?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Special arrangements had been made, and
I was permitted to come up to the city on the tug
that brought the mail. I came straight here and
have been waiting ever since. The letter has not
arrived yet; therefore it must come soon.”</p>

<p>“And when it does?” Caruth’s wonder was growing.
Dimly he suspected whither the conversation
was tending, and with growing interest he waited
for his guest to come to the point. “When it does?”
he questioned again, gently.</p>

<p>The girl’s breath came faster. She evaded a
direct answer.</p>

<p>“You see, Mr. Caruth,” she argued, “I do not
try to conceal from you the importance of this letter.
It is of the very highest value to me and to my friends.
To you, it is neither of value nor of importance, and,
not being intended for you, it does not belong to you.
It was sent to you by mistake. I have come to ask
you to give it back to me unopened. Will you do it?”</p>

<p>Caruth drew a long breath. The inborn tendency
of all men of his race to do anything that a pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
woman wishes impelled him to promise. Yet the
request was certainly amazing.</p>

<p>“You ask a good deal, Miss Fitzhugh,” he temporized.
“I know nothing of this letter. I have
no correspondents that I know of in Sweden—nor
in Europe either, for that matter. You may be right
in saying that the letter is not intended for me; yet—well,
I think I am entitled to ask a little further
explanation. How is it possible for a letter not
intended for me to be addressed to me here—for I
presume it is so addressed?”</p>

<p>Miss Fitzhugh drew herself up. “Yes, the address
is correct,” she answered coldly. “I have told you
it was put on by mistake by a friend of mine who
sends me to reclaim the letter——”</p>

<p>She broke off suddenly, as with startling abruptness
the electric bell at the door of the apartment
sounded in their ears. “There! It’s come! Go
quick,” she cried.</p>

<p>Mechanically Caruth rose and turned to the door;
then hesitated. “Wilkins will bring it,” he explained.</p>

<p>“Wilkins? Your man? No! Go yourself. This
matter is too grave to trust to any one. Go quick.”</p>

<p>Under the spell of her command, Caruth stepped
hastily to the door of the room and flung it open.
At the end of the hall the valet was just signing the
book of a letter carrier. As Caruth appeared he
looked up. “Quick delivery letter for you, sir,” he
said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>Caruth took the letter, nodded, and turned back
into the room.</p>

<p>The girl was standing where he had left her. Her
lips were parted, and her breath came fast. When
she saw the letter her eyes glistened and she stretched
out her hand.</p>

<p>But Caruth drew back. “One moment,” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes flashed. “What do you mean?”
she demanded. “I have explained my claim to that
letter. You have no right to keep it. Give it to me
at once.” An imperious stamp of her foot put a
period to her words.</p>

<p>A weaker man would have yielded, but Caruth
set his jaws. “You have set forth your claim to
this letter,” he answered coldly, “after a fashion.
But, if you will pardon my saying so, you have by
no means proved your right to it. It may very well
have been mailed to me by mistake, and you may
know it—without being entitled to it.”</p>

<p>Scornfully the woman stared at him. Her head
was thrown back, and the breath whistled through
her distended nostrils.</p>

<p>“So!” she breathed, at last. “So this is American
manhood! For the first time in my life, my word
has been questioned to my face.”</p>

<p>Caruth looked, as he felt, acutely uncomfortable.
“No, no!” he protested eagerly. “I don’t question
your word. I didn’t know that you had given it.
Nobody”—a flash of admiration showed in his
eyes—“nobody could look at you and doubt you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
I don’t doubt that you have told me the exact facts.
But I am also very sure that you have not told me
all of them. If the letter does not belong to me, I will
willingly surrender it to the real owner. But I might
do endless harm by surrendering it to the wrong
party. I cannot give it up without knowing more.”</p>

<p>Caruth quailed as he spoke. It was terribly hard
even to debate anything this woman asked. Scarcely
could he force himself to go on. “I must know
more,” he pleaded. “Really, I must know more!
Don’t you see that I must?”</p>

<p>“Very well. You shall.” The woman paused for
an instant and then went on: “This letter and
another were put into a bottle which was thrown
overboard from a sinking ship. It floated about
until ten days ago, when it was picked up by a fisherman.
One of the letters was for my friends. The
address was legible, and it was forwarded to us by
mail, reaching us twenty-four hours later. The
address on the other had partly faded; the name of
the person for whom it was meant had disappeared
altogether. But it was addressed in your care, at
your address here. The fisherman who found it
showed it to a casual American, who advised him to
send it on to you, and who provided him with an envelope
and postage, including a quick delivery stamp.</p>

<p>“When our letter came, we hurried down to question
the fisherman, and from him learned what I
have told you. Our letter had once contained all
the information we needed, but part of the writing
had been washed out by the sea water, and could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
not be read. We hope that the letter sent to you
may be in better condition, so I have hurried over
here to get it from you.”</p>

<p>Caruth listened amazedly. “But,” he objected,
“for whom was the letter really meant?”</p>

<p>“I do not know. Evidently for some one associated
with you. Can you not guess?”</p>

<p>Caruth shook his head slowly. “No,” he mused.
“No, I cannot guess.” Curiously he studied the
envelope he held in his hands.</p>

<p>The woman hesitated; then came to a sudden
resolution. “There are two envelopes,” she explained.
“One of them was put on by the fisherman.
Open that, if you will, but be careful.”</p>

<p>Caruth obeyed and drew out the inclosure. It
was a small envelope, dirty and stained and smelling
strongly of fish. Indeed, a minute scale clung to one
corner until he mechanically brushed it away. On
the face, in blurred writing, appeared his own name:
“Care Mr. Alston Caruth, Chimneystack Apartment
Building, New York, N. Y.” Another name had
been written just above, but it was indecipherable.</p>

<p>“The whole address was there when the fisherman
opened the bottle,” explained the girl. “Part
of it soaked off in his pocket on the way to shore.
Can you make it out?”</p>

<p>Caruth studied the superscription, and shook his
head. “No,” he declared; “I can make out nothing.
But I soon will.” With a quick motion, he ripped
open the envelope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>Before he could draw out the contents, the girl
caught his hand. “Wait!” she cried. “Wait!
Have I not proved my right to that letter?”</p>

<p>Caruth shook his head. “Certainly not,” he
decided. “So far as I can see, neither you nor I
have any title to it, or any right to read it. Nor do
I intend to read it further than to see whether the
inside gives any clue to the man for whom it is
intended.”</p>

<p>“Wait!” Tensely the girl’s hand fell on his arm.
“If nothing else will avail,” she cried, “will not my
entreaties do so. I beg you, I implore you, to give
me that letter. It is nothing to you; it may easily be
life or death to me. You do not know for whom it is
meant. You are under no obligations to an unknown
writer and an unknown addressee. Do not look into
it farther. Give me the letter, I implore you!”</p>

<p>She leaned forward. Her violet eyes gleamed into
his; her lips quivered, her form shook with the stress.
“Oh!” she pleaded. “Give it to me. You will
give it to me?”</p>

<p>A sudden passion flamed in Caruth’s veins—a
passion that gripped and shook him. “By God!”
he cried hoarsely. “You—you——”</p>

<p>The girl started back and dropped her hand.
Then her lips curled. Men were all alike, after all.
American men were no better than their European
brothers. She had seen so many; so very many.
Caruth would yield, and she would despise him for
it. Yet she went on. “Give it to me,” she breathed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“No!” Caruth’s voice rang out. “No! No! Oh,
you women! You beautiful women! How easily you
beguile men! How dare you do it? How dare you
use beauty such as yours for such a purpose? How
dare you use such tools to gain your selfish ends?”</p>

<p>“How dare I?” The girl’s form straightened till
to Caruth’s gaze she seemed to tower above him.
“How dare I?” Her voice was low and thrilling,
but it did not quiver. “How dare I? I dare because
my country calls me to do it. All that I am and have
belongs to it. My future, my liberty, my life, are all
at its service. I am entitled to that letter—I swear
it. If you ask it, I will tell you everything, and in
so doing put my life in your hands. Shall I do it?”</p>

<p>Caruth drew his hand across his eyes. “No!”
he said hoarsely. “I believe you. Take the letter.”</p>

<p>Eagerly the woman reached out her hand, but
before her fingers could close upon the envelope,
the portières that hung between the apartment and
an inner room clashed gently on their rings and
Caruth’s valet pushed his way through them. “I
beg pardon, sir!” he murmured deferentially.</p>

<p>Annoyed, Caruth faced him, the hand holding the
letter dropping to his side. “Well, Wilkins?” he
questioned coldly.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, sir,” repeated the man. “But I
think that letter belongs to me, sir. Will you kindly
look inside and see if it doesn’t begin ‘My dear Jim’
and end ‘Yours, Bill,’ sir? If it does, it is certainly
mine, sir. I think it’s from my brother Bill, sir.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THREE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SLOWLY Caruth regained his balance. The
valet’s deferential plea came like a tonic to his
overstrung nerves. Nothing was more natural
than that Wilkins should have had a letter addressed
in his care; he wondered that the possibility of this
had not occurred to him at once. And with the
advent of the valet, the whole situation had become
ridiculous; he felt as if he had been playing a part
in some melodrama and had suddenly stepped back
into the realm of common sense. With a laugh on
his lips, he turned to Miss Fitzhugh.</p>

<p>His lips straightened and his smile froze. Never
had he seen such disappointment on the face of a
woman. Her eyes glared roundly and her breath
whistled through her parted lips. Blindly she
caught at the table, like one about to collapse. Her
trembling fingers touched a wine-glass, and mechanically
she lifted it to her lips.</p>

<p>As she drank, the color came back to her cheeks
and her eyes brightened. Caruth, watching, noticed
that she was listening to some one. An instant later
he realized that it was Wilkins, and, with an effort,
he wrenched his eyes away from hers and turned
them on the valet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>The man’s attitude was deferential in the extreme.
His eyes were discreetly dropped, and he seemed
unaware of the confusion his appearance had caused.
“I had a brother that was a sea-faring man, sir,”
he was saying. “Sailed out of Lunnon in the steamship
<i>Orkney</i> for St. Petersburg, hard on two years
ago, sir. She was never heard from again. Lost at
sea somewheres, sir. The letter may be from him,
sir. I told him to write me in your care, sir.”</p>

<p>Miss Fitzhugh did not speak, and Caruth hesitated,
but only for a moment. Slowly he opened the letter
and glanced at the top and bottom of the scrawl;
mechanically he refolded it and slipped it back into
its envelope. “You’ve hit it, Wilkins,” he declared.
“The letter does begin ‘Dear Jim’ and does end
‘Your brother, Bill.’ Your claim seems to be clear.”
He handed the letter to the man.</p>

<p>As the latter took it, the woman came out of her
trance. “Wilkins!” she called sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes, madam.” The valet turned toward her,
subservient as ever.</p>

<p>Without taking her eyes from him, Miss Fitzhugh
sank into her chair. “So, Wilkins,” she said slowly,
“you have been listening?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam.” There was no defiance nor
disrespect in the valet’s tones, nor was there any
apology. He simply admitted the undeniable fact,
as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>“It is a vice of servants the world over. When one
subordinates himself to the will of another, he seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
to lose many of the manly virtues. If you have been
listening, Wilkins, you know that I put a high value
on that letter. It seems that it is yours. Well, I will
buy it from you—unread. What is your price?”</p>

<p>Slowly the man shook his head. “I would rather
not sell it, madam,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! Of course you will sell it.” The
woman spoke imperiously, but the valet did not
change his submissive yet dogged bearing. “I have
not much money with me, but I will give you five
hundred dollars cash for it.”</p>

<p>Again Wilkins shook his head. “I can’t consider
it, madam,” he repeated.</p>

<p>Miss Fitzhugh opened the bag that swung from
her belt and threw a roll of bills on the table. “Count
that for me, please, Mr. Caruth,” she ordered. “I
am not quick at American money.”</p>

<p>Caruth obeyed in silence. Though Wilkins was
clearly within his rights, he found himself regarding
the man with rising anger, and would have intervened
if it had seemed possible for him to do so.
But the situation for the time being, at least, was
dearly beyond his control. “Eleven hundred and
fifty-one dollars,” he announced.</p>

<p>“It is all I have. Take it and give me the letter.”
Miss Fitzhugh was again addressing the valet.</p>

<p>For the third time Wilkins shook his head. “No!”
he repeated doggedly.</p>

<p>Undisturbed, the woman turned to Caruth.
“Lend me a thousand dollars,” she requested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Caruth started. Then, with a smile, he took out
his pocket-book and added its contents to the pile.
“There’s only about seven hundred here, Wilkins,”
he remarked, half humorously, “but I’ll give you
my check for the balance—if you’ll accept it.”</p>

<p>The letter rustled in Wilkins’s fingers as he twisted
and turned it. Obviously he was tempted. Yet,
after a quick questioning glance at the woman’s
face, he again shook his head. “No, madam,” he
replied coolly. “Bill took a good deal of trouble to
get this to me, and I fancy it’s valuable. Any way,
I think I’ll chance it, madam.”</p>

<p>“Valuable!” The woman stared at the valet in
seeming surprise. “Nonsense!” she scoffed. “What
could your Bill tell you that could be worth eighteen
hundred dollars. If you suppose that the information
I hope it contains will be worth anything to you
in a money way, you are mistaken. It would cost
you your life to try to use it. Be wise: take the money
and give me the letter. The value of the letter to us
lies chiefly in preventing other people from getting it.”</p>

<p>“Very well, madam. I’ll destroy it, then, madam.”
He stepped to the fire and made a motion to throw
it upon the flames.</p>

<p>Like a cat, the woman sprang forward and caught
his arm, her silken skirts hissing as she moved.
“No, no!” she cried.</p>

<p>A triumphant smile curled the valet’s lips. “Very
well, madam,” he acceded meekly. “As you wish,
madam.”</p>

<p class="caption">LIKE A CAT, THE WOMAN SPRANG FORWARD AND CAUGHT HIS ARM</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>The woman fell back a step, and stood staring at
the valet. For the first time, she seemed to try to
take his measure as a man, and to bend her faculties
to reading the lines of his features. “Humph!”
she murmured, at last, in a singular tone. “I am
beginning to see. How long have you been with
Mr. Caruth, Wilkins?”</p>

<p>“Two years, madam.”</p>

<p>“You brought recommendations, of course! Mr.
Caruth, I should advise you to look up the writers
of those recommendations at once. You may learn
something that will surprise you. Now, Wilkins,
listen to me.” A subtle change came into Miss
Fitzhugh’s voice; she might almost have been addressing
an equal. “You have played your part
well and have served your master well. But you had
better not push matters too far. It is dangerous.”</p>

<p>A glint of fear crept into the valet’s eyes, and his
look wandered up and down the girl’s person, as if
expecting to see a weapon; almost he seemed to
fear an attack of some kind. “Dangerous in what
way, madam?” he asked, still respectfully.</p>

<p>“Dangerous by violence. Do you think those
who sent me here—four thousand miles—to get that
letter, will let you escape with it? Once you have
read it, there will be no more safety for you on the
face of the earth. Death will dog your footsteps and
sit by your side. Sleeping and waking, he will be upon
you. You cannot beg for mercy, for there will be no
one from whom to beg. When I go out of that door,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
I disappear, and even if you could find me, it would
not save you, for I am only an agent, powerless to
change the will of my superiors. I give you my word
that in asking for that letter I am trying to save your
life, as well as to gain my own ends. I give you my
word that I know of no way in which you can evade
your fate, once you have read it. For the last time,
I beg you, take the money and give me the letter.”</p>

<p>There was silence in the room as the valet turned
the letter over and over, staring at it, hesitating.
His fingers trembled and his eyes grew wider.</p>

<p>With a shock, Caruth realized that murder had
been threatened in his very presence—and that he
was not horrified, as he knew he ought to have been.
Rather, he sympathized with the woman, who towered
above the man in angry beauty.</p>

<p>At last the valet broke the silence. “My God!”
he whispered. “My God!” Slowly and unsteadily,
he made his way to the table and laid the letter upon
it. Slowly, he picked up the bills one by one. Then
he raised his heavy eyes and for an instant looked
into the face of the woman. The next moment he
was at the door, hurrying away with the swift, silent
footsteps of the well-trained servant. The portières
fell together behind him.</p>

<p>With a long sigh of relief, the girl picked up the
letter. The strain of the past moments showed itself
in her face.</p>

<p>“I will return your money as soon as I can see
my friends,” she declared weariedly. “Meanwhile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
perhaps you will retain this.” She stripped a ring
from her fingers. “It is worth more than the money,”
she added.</p>

<p>Caruth drew back, deeply hurt. “Thank you,”
he returned angrily, “but I am not a pawnbroker—even
if I am accessory to a threat to commit murder.
Return the money when you like.”</p>

<p>He spoke bitterly, for he was furious that he should
have allowed his man to be forced into the surrender
of his rights. Man-like, he felt the necessity of
blaming his own derelictions on some one else.</p>

<p>Miss Fitzhugh seemed to understand, for she
stepped forward and laid her hand on his arm.
“Believe me, Mr. Caruth,” she declared earnestly,
“believe me, you have done right. Whatever value
this letter possessed belongs to us of right. The
man who wrote it betrayed a secret that was not
his; and, whether his or no, your valet could not
have profited by it. You have done a good deed,
and you have been as kind and true and staunch to
me as my own brother could have been. My mother
was right when she told me a woman could always
appeal safely to an American gentleman. Now,
good-night and good-by.”</p>

<p>Alarm drove away Caruth’s misgivings. “You—you
will let me see you again,” he begged.</p>

<p>Slowly the woman shook her head. “I fear not,”
she answered. “I shall sail for home on the next
steamer—this very day if I can find one leaving.
This is good-by.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>“But—but—where are you going? It is not easy
for a woman to find accommodations at this time of
the night. See, it is after twelve o’clock. Won’t
you stay here? I can easily go to a hotel.”</p>

<p>Again the woman shook her head. “I have friends
waiting for me,” she averred. “Good-night.”</p>

<p>The blackness of despair settled on Caruth.
“But—but—I can’t let you go like this. I must
see you again. Tell me where your home is. Let
me hope to see you there some day. I’ve known
you only an hour or two, but I can’t—I can’t let you
go out of my life this way, without a word or a sign.
I must see—good God! What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>On the woman’s face a look of frozen horror had
dawned. Her eyes dropped from his to the letter
she had unconsciously withdrawn from its envelope;
and following them, Caruth saw in her hand a sheet
of paper, stiff and white, very different from the soft,
sea-stained sheet he had handled a few moments
before. It scarcely needed her terrified words to
give the explanation.</p>

<p>“He has substituted another letter!” she cried.
“He was acting all the time! And I did not guess!
I did not guess! He has gone with the hope of Russia
in his hands!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FOUR</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">RECKLESSLY Caruth plunged down the half-lighted
steps. The elevator had stopped running,
and, in any event, he had no time to
wait for elevators. Down he sped, past tight-shut
doors, whose occupants slept calmly despite his noisy
rush; over marble steps, through tessellated halls,
round slippery corners. Twice he nearly fell, but he
saved himself and went on, bursting at last like a
meteor on the scandalized watchman, whom the clatter
of his coming had roused from a blameless nap.</p>

<p>“Now, now, now!” clamored that individual.
“What in hell’s bells you think you’re doing, gallopin’
like this? Why, it’s Mr. Caruth!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s I.” The young man’s breath came in
gasps. One does not race down eight flights of
steps without showing the effects. “Yes, it’s I!
Has my man, Wilkins, gone out in the last five
minutes?”</p>

<p>“Wilkins? Naw! Say, Mr. Caruth, you’d better
go to bed and sleep it off, or it’ll be you for the psychopathic
ward the first thing you know.”</p>

<p>“Bosh! Wilkins has run away from my rooms
with a valuable letter and eighteen hundred dollars
in money. Are you sure he hasn’t passed you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>“Eighteen hundred! Gee! ’Course I’m sure.
Ain’t I been here right along?”</p>

<p>Caruth drew a long breath and glanced up the stairway
down which he had just raced. So sure had he
been that Wilkins had fled that he had not stopped to
search in his own apartments. A suspicion that he
had made himself ridiculous began to penetrate to his
brain, and he glanced shamefacedly at the watchman.</p>

<p>That individual was regarding him suspiciously.
He caught the look, interpreted it correctly, and
smiled encouragingly. “It’s all right, Mr. Caruth,”
he extenuated. “It’s all to the regular for a gent
to have the nightmare when he goes to sleep in his
chair. Just you go back to your rooms and take a
dose of bromide and say your lay-me-downs, and
neither of us’ll remember anything about this to-morrow.
I’d start the elevator for you if I could,
but I can’t, so it’s you for the glue-foot climb.”</p>

<p>Caruth scarcely heard the man. His first spasm
of distrust in his own action had quickly passed,
and by the time the other had finished he had gone
back to his first idea.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Jackson!” he burst out impatiently.
“I haven’t been asleep. Wilkins has fled within five
minutes. If he hasn’t passed you, he must have
gone some other way. How else could he go?
Quick, man! He must be caught.”</p>

<p>But the watchman refused to be hurried. “There
ain’t no way out but this,” he declared, “unless he
done a high dive from the fire-escape.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Caruth started. He had forgotten the dangerous
combination of open platforms and loose-hung
ladders plastered across the hall windows on each
floor. If Wilkins had taken that means of escape,
as was entirely probable, he must be well out of
reach, and no way to find him would remain except
the slow appeal to the police. He would call up
the headquarters and——</p>

<p>Suddenly he recalled his visitor. Would she care
to have the affair made public? Certainly he could
not act without consulting her.</p>

<p>The watchman’s voice broke on him. That individual
had switched on the lights in the hall, and had
gone back to where a closed door gave on an alley.
“We’ll take a look at that Jacob’s ladder just to satisfy
you, Mr. Caruth,” he called. “See here!” He threw
open the door and let Caruth step out into the night.</p>

<p>At first the alley seemed dark, but soon objects
began to stand out in the faint light. First the skyline
showed, clear against the towering sides of the
chasm, then the iron of the fire-escape disentangled
itself from the darkness and began to show in rectangular
tracery.</p>

<p>Before Caruth could distinguish more, the watchman
uttered an exclamation. “By George!” he
cried. “Somebody <i>has</i> been on that escape. It’s
been let down.”</p>

<p>Caruth looked where the other pointed. Plainly
discernible now to his distended pupils, the lowest
stretch of the iron ladder trailed across his field of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
vision. Some one had cut loose the fastenings that
held it high in the air, out of reach of casual sneak
thieves, and had lowered it to the ground.</p>

<p>Wilkins’s selection of a route was obvious. But
it was also obvious that he was gone.</p>

<p>Caruth turned disconsolately away. He was beginning
to wonder what had become of Miss Fitzhugh.
When he had started down the stairs, she had been
close behind him, and he had expected her to follow,
but though more than time enough for her to reach
the bottom had elapsed, she had not appeared. His
first thought was that she had remained above out
of some belated care for her reputation. Then,
quickly following, came the possibility of a more
sinister explanation.</p>

<p>The incidents of the night to his mind admitted
but one explanation. Despite her American name
(which might well have been assumed) the girl was
a Russian, and he who says Russia nowadays connotes
revolution, plots, arrests, and all the rest of the
melodrama. The girl might be a nihilist or she
might be a police spy, but he was sure that she must
be one or the other. And Wilkins was her enemy.
She had recognized him as such—not at first, but
toward the end, when he had tricked her by his
feint of throwing the letter in the fire. Caruth remembered
her every word. And he had left her
alone! How did he know that Wilkins had gone?
How did he know that he had not concealed himself
and waited——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>Slow and long-drawn-out when written down,
the sequence of events with all its possibilities
flashed like lightning through his mind. His hair
rose upon his head, and the sweat stood out upon
his forehead. His heart thumped furiously! Scarcely
could he comprehend the words of the watchman.</p>

<p>Yet that individual was cursing roundly. “I’d
like to know who in h——’s setting leaky pots out
on that escape,” he finished. “Dropping stuff on
a man’s clothes and spoilin’——”</p>

<p>The voice died away in an inarticulate murmur,
and Caruth saw the man’s face blanch as he held
out his hand. “It’s blood,” he hissed. “Blood!
Blood! Somebody’s bleedin’ like a stuck pig up
there. Somebody’s been murdered.” He ran down
the hall and pressed the button of a police call.
Then he came hurrying back.</p>

<p>“Here; you!” he shouted, his respectful manner
falling from him like a garment. “Chase up them
steps to the third floor and meet me at the window.
On your way, now, Willie!”</p>

<p>Caruth came out of his trance and sped up the
main stairway as the watchman ran up the fire-escape.
One flight—two flights—three flights! Along the
hall he rushed and threw open the window, just as
the watchman reached it from below.</p>

<p>The electric lights threw a white glare upon the
grating and upon a human form huddled across
it in a strange, unnatural shape. The light fell upon
the livid face and staring eyes and upon the dark<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
spot that marred the whiteness of the open shirt
bosom. Caruth drew his breath sobbingly. For
the body was not that which he had feared to see.</p>

<p>The watchman bent and peered into the white
face. “It’s Wilkins, all right,” he commented.
“He didn’t get far with that eighteen hundred of
yours. Somebody must have been laying for him.
They’ve turned his pockets inside out, and I guess
they got it, all right.” Deftly he ran his hand over
the body.</p>

<p>“Nothin’ doing,” he reported. “They’ve skinned
him clean. Here, Mr. Caruth! The cops’ll be here
in a minute. I wish you’d chase down and put ’em
wise.”</p>

<p>Caruth obeyed as he would have obeyed any
behest of the stronger will. The situation had dazed
him. An immense relief mingled with an immense
terror; relief that his worst fears had not been realized;
terror lest something even worse had happened
in its stead. Wilkins was dead; presumably the
woman still lived. But whose hand had struck the
blow?</p>

<p>A swish of silk sounded in his ears, and he looked
up. She was there before him, peering downward
with curious, frightened eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Caruth,” she called, in hushed tones. “Mr.
Caruth! Has anything happened?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” Relief was in his voice. Her bearing
was not that of a murderess.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“I have no time to tell you. You must go. The
police are coming, and you must not be seen.
Hurry!”</p>

<p>The unsolved mystery of the girl’s visit had grown
blacker than ever, but Caruth did not hesitate. He
knew that it was his duty to detain her till the fire-escape
had given up its secret, but not for a moment
did he pause. He refused to think of what it all
meant. He only knew that he was on her side, heart
and soul, and would do her bidding till he died.</p>

<p>“Hurry,” he repeated. “There isn’t a moment to
lose.”</p>

<p>But the girl held back. “The letter,” she pleaded.
“I cannot go without it.”</p>

<p>“You must. I didn’t want to tell you, but—Wilkins
has been murdered, and the police are
coming. The letter is out of reach, for the moment
anyhow. You must go at once. The police will be
here in a moment.” He hurried her to the door and
peered out. Bare and silent in the first break of
dawn, the street stretched interminably away. No
human being seemed to stir. But as he listened a
far-away rumble grew on his ears.</p>

<p>“The patrol wagon!” he gasped. “This way!
Quick! God help you!”</p>

<p>In an instant she was gone, hurrying swiftly down
the street, with steps that did not falter. Caruth
watched till he saw a man’s figure step from the
shadows to join her, and the two vanish around a
corner. Then, sick at heart, as only the young can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
be when they find their heart’s idol clay, he turned
back to greet the police. They were at his elbow—six
of them—leaping from a wagon and hurrying
forward. “What’s doing?” demanded the foremost.</p>

<p>“Murder! On the third-floor fire-escape. The
watchman is there.”</p>

<p>The officer spun round. “On your way, boys!”
he ordered. “Front and back!” He turned to
Caruth. “Who did it?” he demanded.</p>

<p>If the young man hesitated, it was only for an
instant. “I don’t know,” he answered. “It’s my
valet. He robbed me and fled. I discovered it a
moment later, and started after him. He had disappeared.
The watchman found his body. His
pockets were empty. Some confederate must have
been waiting for him.”</p>

<p>The two men were alone in the hall. The other
officers had all vanished, some through the rear
entrance; some up the stairs. The crowd that was
to come had not yet gathered, though the sound of
running footsteps outside showed that its first units
were coming, attracted by the clatter of the patrol.</p>

<p>The officer, used to scenes of excitement, and
knowing the importance of ideas expressed before
those in touch with tragedy had time consciously
or unconsciously to mould their opinions, waited
to ask one more question before he too hurried to
the rear.</p>

<p>“Suspect anybody?” he demanded. “Seen anybody
suspicious?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Caruth looked him straight in the face. “No,”
he lied. “No, I’ve seen nobody. As I said, the man
robbed me, and I suppose some confederate
killed him for his booty.”</p>

<p>When the officer had gone, Caruth turned and
with leaden feet climbed the weary stairs that led
to his room. He did not stop at the third floor, nor
go again to inspect the lump of pallid flesh that
alone remained of his servant. In fact, for the time
he had altogether forgotten Wilkins. The murder
had driven the murdered man from his mind.</p>

<p>He had answered the officer on the spur of the
moment, thinking only to shield the girl, and not
considering the possible—yes, the inevitable—consequences.
The words once said, he would have
given worlds to recall them, and yet he knew that
he would only have reiterated them, if given the
chance.</p>

<p>He would have no such chance, however. The
true tale of the night’s events would have been preposterous
enough at best. He could fancy how a
hard-headed American jury would have listened to
it, and how even a fourth-rate lawyer would have
proved its impossibility. But, at all events, in telling
it, he would have been telling the truth, and would
have had the consciousness of rectitude to support
him.</p>

<p>But his hasty answer had made the truth impossible,
and he must go on piling lie upon lie in sickening
iteration. Liars need good memories; would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
his prove equal to the task? Would no one catch
him tripping? His answer had made him a criminal
in the eyes of the law—an accessory after the fact.
The thought sickened him; and yet mingled with
his dismay was a fierce joy that he was doing it for
her sake—for the sake of the woman who had walked
into his life a few moments before; a woman of whose
status and probably of whose real name he was
ignorant.</p>

<p>Why had he done it, he asked himself with dazed
wonder. He owed her nothing. She had forced
herself on him, had cajoled him, and had finally
fled, leaving him to bear the brunt of her crime—hers
or her accomplices. He had done all she asked,
had aided her meekly, and at the end had placed
himself in shameful jeopardy without even being
asked to do so. Harshly he laughed as he thought
of it.</p>

<p>Then he threw out his hands. “There’s no use
in thinking,” he muttered. “I’m a fool—but it’s
stronger than I am. I must go on to the end—and
lie and lie and lie.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FIVE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AFTER all, matters went off very quietly. The
murder of James Wilkins caused a surprisingly
small sensation. Circumstances were
against it. A prominent statesman had just denounced
another prominent statesman for having
accepted the tainted money of a wicked trust, and the
accused statesman was calling heaven and earth as
witness to his innocence; the champion heavyweight
pugilist of the country had just given way to a new
champion; and the Black Hand had blown up a
restaurant whose proprietor had defied it. The
papers had little space left for a plain case of robbery
and murder, such as that of Wilkins seemed to be.</p>

<p>Caruth had told a straight story, which had been
accepted at its face value. According to him, he had
come home late and had sat down to smoke before
going to bed. He had laid some money—about
eighteen hundred dollars in bills—on the table beside
him. Wilkins had been moving about and had
seen the money and after a moment had left the room.
When Caruth looked for the money an instant later
it had disappeared. He had hurried downstairs in
hope of catching the man, and with the aid of the
night watchman had found his body. On looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
up the references Wilkins had brought him, he had
found that they were forged. He suspected, therefore,
that the man had entered his service with sinister
intent, and had been murdered by a confederate who
had come to join him in the robbery.</p>

<p>The recital of this combination of fact and fancy
gave Caruth no compunctions so far as Wilkins was
concerned; the man’s references really were forged,
and he had really stolen the money, by whatever
particular name the law might label his act.</p>

<p>To Caruth, this tale seemed very lame, but, to
his astonishment, no one questioned it. So utterly
was this the case that it irritated him; it seemed to
him extraordinary that the actual sequence of events
could have happened without in some way impressing
itself on the intelligence of every one who came
within reach of it. He did not want to be suspected,
yet the lack of detective ability on the part of the
police angered him. Why this should be so, let
psychologists explain.</p>

<p>The money borrowed from him by the so-called
Miss Fitzhugh had been returned the afternoon
after the crime in the form of a money-order sent
by mail, about as clever a way of combining safety
in transmission with concealment of the sender as
could well be contrived. Clearly she did not desire
to continue the acquaintance.</p>

<p>Caruth did! For several days he carefully abstained
from any search, fearing that to do so might
excite suspicion, but after a week had passed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Wilkins seemed forgotten, he began to think it safe
to start inquiries.</p>

<p>His search began at the steamship offices. He
first examined the passenger list of the <i>Latourette</i>,
the vessel on which Miss Fitzhugh had claimed to
have arrived, and sought for her name, only to find
that it was not there. Less hopefully, he examined
the lists of the vessels sailing from New York during
the week that had elapsed since the murder, only
to find no trace of her. Finally something happened
that determined him to enlist the aid of Joe Bristow,
a newspaper man of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Bristow was ship-news reporter of the Consolidated
Press. His duties required him to remain at
Quarantine so long as any steamship was likely to
arrive there. Ordinarily he left for the city at five
or six o’clock in the afternoon, but if one of the
great liners reported itself by wireless as intending to
make port that night, he had to remain to see what
news and passengers she brought. Few steamships
reached New York without being boarded by him,
and few important visitors entered port without
being interviewed by him. He, if any one, would
be likely to know if anybody answering Miss Fitzhugh’s
description had arrived recently.</p>

<p>Caruth, who knew him slightly as the occupant
of a small apartment high up in the Chimneystack
Building, took the first opportunity that afforded
to accost him and to invite him into his apartment.</p>

<p>Bristow accepted readily, though a faint smile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
curved his lips, as if some secret idea were stirring
in his mind. He did not know Caruth very well,
though he had frequently passed the time of day
with him, and he had never before been asked to
join the young fellow. Newspaper men are apt to
grow cynical, and Bristow had learned to suspect
the motives of those who sought him out.</p>

<p>Caruth led his guest to his den, and placed the
decanters before him. Then, through the wreaths of
tobacco smoke, he put his question, leading up to it
with what he believed to be commendable astuteness.</p>

<p>Bristow listened quietly; then he answered one
question with another. “The <i>Latourette</i>?” he repeated.
“Yes; she arrived at eight o’clock on the
night of March 5. Her mails and two of her passengers
were brought up to the city on the mail tug.
Let’s see—that was the night your valet was murdered,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>Caruth blenched slightly. The reporter’s inquiry
was probably only casual, but it might easily be
otherwise. Perhaps he had erred in consulting this
keen-faced newspaper man. However, there was
nothing to do but to go on.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered steadily; “it was the same
night.”</p>

<p>Bristow nodded. “I saw the lady,” he stated
reflectively. “She was a looker all right. She had
deep violet eyes and dark hair with a glint in it.
She spoke English perfectly, but there was something
foreign about her.” He paused and knocked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
ash from his cigar. “I came up on the tug with her,”
he added casually.</p>

<p>“Yes? And her name? I—I—have reasons for
wanting to know.”</p>

<p>Bristow smiled inscrutably. “I don’t doubt you
have,” he answered drily, “and, as it happens, I can
probably give you some information. The question
is whether I shall do it.”</p>

<p>Caruth colored. “I don’t understand you, Mr.
Bristow,” he syllabled anxiously.</p>

<p>“Probably not. I will try to explain.” The reporter
tossed his cigar into the fire and leaned back
in his chair. “Isn’t it curious how things fit in together?”
he began reflectively. “Life is a mosaic
made up of hundreds of separate facts. Each belongs
in one place and only in one. Until rightly fitted,
the whole is an unintelligible jumble. But when
fitted, we see that they are all parts of one design.
I am interested in Russia and Russians. My work
has compelled me to be; some of the best ‘stories’
I have gotten for the Consolidated Press have had
to do with Russia. I am well acquainted in the
Russian colony here. Professor Shishkin, the distinguished
Russian scientist, is a great friend of
mine. I’m telling you this so that you may understand
why I was interested in this woman—this
Russian woman, for she was Russian—about whom
you are inquiring. My interest did not decrease
when she took a cab at the Battery and told the
cabman to drive her to this building.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>Caruth gasped, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“When I returned home after midnight,” went on
the reporter, “the elevator had stopped running,
and I had to walk up the stairs. Your door was
ajar. As I passed it I distinctly heard a woman’s
voice—and yours. It was none of my business, and
I went on upstairs and to bed. The next morning
I heard about your valet’s murder, and noticed that
you said nothing about a visitor in your flat. Yet a
woman must have been there when your man fled;
in fact, I suspect that he had left your door open in
his flight only a moment before I passed up the stairs.
Your inquiry seems to bring all these facts into a
somewhat curious consonance.”</p>

<p>Caruth was breathing hard. “Well?” he asked.
“What are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p>The reporter hesitated. “I don’t know,” he answered
at last, frankly. “It all depends! But I want
you to understand one thing, Mr. Caruth: I am not
a police reporter nor a yellow sensation reporter.
My duty to the Consolidated Press does not call on
me to solve murder mysteries, nor to pry into scandals.
I don’t know you very well, nor what you are
capable of doing at a pinch. For the matter of that,
nobody does know what a man is capable of—not
even himself. I’ve seen too many unexpected manifestations
of virtue and of crime to judge lightly.
That is why I have kept silent, though I knew you
were holding back something about this murder. I
don’t think to-night’s developments will lead me to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
change my course, though I cannot be certain. If
you have any explanation to make, I shall be glad to
hear it. I shall not make a newspaper story out of
it, and I shall not repeat it without grave cause.
More than this I cannot promise.”</p>

<p>Caruth did not answer for a moment. His thoughts
whirled, unsettled as dry leaves in an October blast.
His secret, it seemed, was not his secret at all—had
never been his secret. From the first, this newspaper
man had been able to shatter his glib story by a
word, and had refrained from doing so. How many
others possessed the same potentiality for mischief?
Abruptly he threw away his cigar.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you the whole story,” he declared. “I
don’t know whether you’ll believe it or not. Probably
I shouldn’t believe it myself if any one else told it
to me. It seems too preposterous to talk about plots
and terrorists and all that here in New York.”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” Bristow smiled. “New York is a
hot-bed of plots. Probably nine-tenths of all the
political plots in the world are hatched here and
hereabouts. Just consider a moment! Anybody
can plot in this country in perfect safety; and there
are plenty of plotters handy. Is it a Russian plot?
New York is the second largest Russian city in the
world. It has thousands upon thousands of dwellers
who have been driven out of Russia at the blow of
the knout. Is it a German one? Berlin is the only
city in the world holding more Germans than New
York. Is it an Italian one? There are more Italians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
in and around New York than there are in Rome.
Plots? Why, New York reeks with plots and plotters!
Men lay their schemes, raise their funds, choose
their emissaries, and a month or so later something
happens in Europe—it may be the murder of a king.
But it started here, beneath our noses.”</p>

<p>“But if there are so many plots, why are there so
few results? We seldom hear——”</p>

<p>“Because if plotters are safe here, so are spies.
Every European Government maintains an army
of spies in this country. Every assemblage of plotters
has one or more traitors in the pay of those who
are menaced. It’s as broad as it’s long. But go on
with your story. I only wanted to assure you that
it will have to be a very remarkable case of plotting
to surprise me.”</p>

<p>Caruth plunged in. “When I came home that
night,” he began, “she was waiting for me. I had
never seen her before. She said she was a Russian—the
daughter of a Russian man and an American
woman. She gave me a name, but it was probably
assumed. She wanted a letter that had been mailed
to me in Stockholm ten days before—by mistake,
she said. It enclosed another letter that had been
picked up in a bottle floating in the Baltic. The
address of this second letter was partly illegible, but
it was directed in my care and was sent to me accordingly.
She said the letter belonged of right to her
friends. While she was speaking the letter arrived—by
special delivery. It seemed to be as she had stated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
I was about to surrender it to her when my man,
Wilkins, claimed it. More, he proved his claim. I
gave him the letter. She tried to buy it from him—offered
eighteen hundred dollars cash for it. Wilkins
refused. Then she threatened him. Said she asked
him to surrender it for his own sake; that he would
be killed if he once read it; that she could not save
him. Of course this smacked of revolution, nihilism,
terrorism. Wilkins appeared to be frightened. He
agreed to surrender the letter. He laid it on the
table, took the money, and went out. Three minutes
later we discovered that he had substituted
blank paper for the letter. I ran after him and
found him dead. The girl left just before the
police came.”</p>

<p>“And you concealed the fact that she had been
here. Why?”</p>

<p>Caruth colored. “It—it isn’t a thing that one tells
to just any one,” he stammered. “But—well, I
suppose it sounds foolish to you, but—I love her.”</p>

<p>The reporter did not smile. “Foolish?” he echoed
gently. “Why foolish? Love is not foolishness.
It’s madness, perhaps, but not foolishness. Good
Heavens! Do you think one can be a newspaper
man and see daily the broad trail of joy and sorrow,
blood, death, ruin, happiness, rapture, and all the
rest of it that love marks athwart the path of human
life, and think it foolishness? Why, man, love
means life! It means the preservation of the race! It
means evolution! It is the one great primal passion!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
No, Mr. Caruth; never expect a newspaper man to
laugh at love. He has seen too much of it. Of course
I knew that must be your reason for screening the
woman. But do you think she killed him?”</p>

<p>Caruth shook his head emphatically. “No!”
he declared. “No!”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“She couldn’t.” The young fellow leaned forward.
“She couldn’t,” he declared eagerly. “See
here: Wilkins took the money and fled. He knew
we would be after him in a moment. He would not
have delayed. He must have been out on that fire-escape
and down to the place where he was killed
before I left the room. This is the eighth floor;
he was found on the third. He must have gone
there by himself. No one could have carried his
body there—not possibly! And it is preposterous
to suppose that he went down to the third floor
and waited there for her to overtake and murder
him. No! She didn’t do it! She couldn’t have
done it.”</p>

<p>“An accomplice?”</p>

<p>Caruth threw up his hands. “Very likely,” he
groaned. “And yet how could an accomplice know
that Wilkins had gotten away with the letter before
she knew it herself? For he was probably dead when
she did discover it. If not, he must have been killed
within a very few seconds afterwards. She made no
signal; she had no reason to make any. How could
an accomplice know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“Let’s see!” Bristow looked around the room.
“You were sitting in here, were you not?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Of course you were. My dear fellow, can’t you
really answer your own question?”</p>

<p>Caruth shook his head hopelessly. “I’ve thought
and thought,” he declared, “but I don’t progress
an inch. Can you answer it?”</p>

<p>“Of course! Look through the sliding doors behind
you. What is that thing that cuts across the
upper left-hand corner of the window at the back?”</p>

<p>Caruth looked, then rose to his feet. Chagrin was
pictured on his features. “Do you know,” he admitted
disgustedly, “I never thought of that before?
I never realized that that infernal fire-escape crossed
my window. There is such a little piece of it
that——”</p>

<p>“There is quite enough to permit a man to peer
into your rooms. No doubt the murderer was
watching there, and when Wilkins tried to escape
by that route he found death awaiting him.”</p>

<p>“But—but—how did the spy know that Wilkins
had changed the letters?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he didn’t know it. Perhaps he was a
mere thief who killed for money; or perhaps he saw
the shift which was made too deftly for you to notice;
or perhaps the girl signalled him.”</p>

<p>Caruth protested. “She couldn’t, I tell you!”
he cried. “The time element——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think she did. I am merely citing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
possibilities. I don’t think she did, and I am free to
admit that I really believe that Wilkins got only what
he was fishing for. He was clearly a thief, and he
seems to have been playing a dangerous game and
to have lost out. I certainly do not feel called upon
to take any steps to avenge him. But the girl is a
different matter. You want to find her. Why?”</p>

<p>“I told you. Because I love her.”</p>

<p>“I understand that. But what then? You can’t
possibly marry her!”</p>

<p>Caruth flushed. He looked very boyish to the
reporter, who, scarcely older in years, was infinitely
his senior in man-making experiences and responsibilities.
Boyish, Caruth was without doubt, but
American boys possess possibilities of rapid development
that amaze the older people of the globe.</p>

<p>“Can’t I?” he answered, between his teeth.
“Perhaps not. But if she is free, I mean to try.
Anyhow, I must see her. I must. You said you might
be able to help me!” he finished, with a boyish appeal
in his voice.</p>

<p>The reporter rose and took up his hat. “I can
give you some information,” he admitted. “Whether
it will help you, is another question. You have been
assuming, I believe, that the lady is a nihilist, or
terrorist, or whatever they may call themselves?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Is she not?”</p>

<p>“God knows! She may be. On the other hand
she may be an agent of the Russian Government,
or she may be playing for her own hand. Europe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
breeds plenty of men and women—aristocrats to
their finger-tips—who are driven by poverty to shady
ways. Until the bloom is rubbed off, they are the
most dangerous rogues living, bearers of proud
names, masters of every social grace, apparently
with everything to commend them, and yet rotten to
the core. Europeans spot them and weed them out
after a while, but we Americans are always fair game.
I don’t say your Miss Fitzhugh is one of these—but
she may be. An angel face is often part of a stock
in trade. Be wise, Mr. Caruth. This woman has
taken herself out of your life. Let her go!”</p>

<p>But the young fellow shook his head. “I won’t
believe any evil of her,” he muttered, “and, any way,
I must find her.”</p>

<p>The reporter shrugged his shoulders. “Oh, very
well, then,” he said. “You’re old enough to decide
for yourself. You will find her at the Women’s
Hotel. She is staying there.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE event that had driven Caruth to seek
Bristow’s aid was the appearance of a man
who called himself Tom Wilkins and claimed
to be a brother of the deceased valet.</p>

<p>Tom Wilkins was a tall, well built, red-faced
individual with a projecting chin and small, sharp
eyes. He bore a general resemblance to his brother
James, but his eyes had a fiery gleam that Caruth
had never noticed in those of his late valet. Perhaps
the difference came by nature and perhaps by training;
or perhaps there was no difference, the valet
having merely hidden his soul behind discreetly
down-dropped lids. Since he had played the trick
that had led to his death, Caruth had been very
uncertain as to his real character.</p>

<p>But he was in little doubt concerning that of Tom
Wilkins. The man, he decided almost at first glance,
was distinctly dangerous. Years of life in the West
had rubbed away any smugness that might have
characterized him in early life, and had made him
bold and aggressive. The quickly arising necessities
of the frontier had developed him, implanting or
improving the power of quick decision and action,
until it was almost automatic. Caruth had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
known a Western “bad man,” but he felt instinctively
that Tom Wilkins would fall into that category.</p>

<p>On his first visit to the Chimneystack Building
Wilkins had said little to Caruth, but that little had
been calculated to disturb the younger man, and
to show him how thin was the ice over which he
was skating.</p>

<p>“There ain’t been no special affectation lost
between me and Jim,” he declared. “I ain’t laid
eyes on him for years. Jim stayed here in the effete
East and played the human doormat; I went West
and played pretty nearly everything and everybody in
reach. Once in so often I’d hear of a chance in stocks
or horses or something that Jim could use, and I’d put
him wise about it. Now and then Jim would learn
of something that I could use, and he’d put me wise.
Jim cat-footed through life, and I bulled through it.
We played into each other’s hands reasonable well.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“Yes! I got sort of tired last month, an’ made
up my mind to emigrate. I had a bunch of sheep
over on the Gunnison that I’d been herdin’, and I
was yearning for the company of something that
wouldn’t say baa whenever you addressed ’em.
Playing collie to a bunch of muttons ain’t what it
used to was when shepherds carried crooks and wore
loose effects, and I found it mighty monumentous
and unsatiated, so I shakes the job and lines out for
Denver, and there I finds a letter from Jim telling
me to come to New York P. D. Q. So I comes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and gets here to find he got croaked just about the
time his essay was postmarked. How about it?”</p>

<p>As gently as he could, Caruth repeated the gist
of his tale concerning the theft of the money and the
murder. It was a somewhat delicate matter to tell
this violent-looking individual that his brother was
a thief, and Caruth stumbled more or less over the
details.</p>

<p>Wilkins, however, did not seem worried. “I
never thought Jim would go into the hold-up business,”
he commented, “especially for a measly
one thousand eight hundred dollars. Maybe you
don’t know it, but Jim was gettin’ tolerable plethoric.
He was mighty saving and propinquous, Jim was;
and he had some property out West—maybe ten
thousand dollars’ worth. I’m his heir, and as I
ain’t been in no ways intimidated with him, of course
I ain’t inconsolable about his decease, nor I ain’t
pretendin’ to be. But this hold-up story don’t
explain none about that letter from Bill that he sent
me.”</p>

<p>Caruth’s heart stopped for an instant; then raced
madly. “What letter?” he questioned, as calmly
as he could.</p>

<p>“This one.” Wilkins drew a paper from his
pocket. “Jim enclosed it with a note of his own.
He says: ‘Come at once. Millions in sight, but
mighty dangerous. Bill’s letter explains.’ Bill’s
letter is monumentous—mighty monumentous; but
it ain’t to say illuminatin’. Maybe Jim forgot to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
send the key. I ’spose you don’t know anything
about it?”</p>

<p>Caruth thought for a moment. To cover his pause,
he poured out a drink and shoved the bottle across
to Wilkins, who promptly followed his example.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I do,” he said at last. “About an hour
before your brother’s flight, a special delivery letter
arrived here from some place in Europe. It was
addressed to me, but when I opened it, I found it
enclosed another, stained and rumpled, which was
addressed in my care. The name of the person for
whom it was intended had been washed out. Your
brother saw it and claimed it was for him. He asked
me to open it and see if it was not addressed to ‘Jim’
and signed ‘Bill.’ I found that it was, and gave it
to him. Perhaps that is the letter he sent you.”</p>

<p>“I reckon it is. And you don’t know nothing
more about it? I don’t ’spose Jim showed it to you.
But he might have intimidated something about it.
You don’t know nothin’ at all?” Plainly the Westerner
was disappointed.</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you unequivalent, Mr. Caruth! I
don’t believe Jim robbed you none. Jim warn’t a
damn fool; none whatever! An’ nobody but a
damn fool would rustle that money the way you
think he did. I’m apostrophizing that the same
parties stole it that did for Jim. An’ I’ve got an
idea they croaked him to get this here crypto cable.
I’m gamblin’ that it’s worth a good deal more’n<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
any eighteen hundred dollars, if a man could only
elusivate it. Sure you don’t know nothin’ more
about it?”</p>

<p>“No!” Caruth’s lips were dry and his tones were
not convincing.</p>

<p>The big plainsman studied him for a moment.
“Well,” he said, “I’ve told you how I feel. Jim’s
dead, and I don’t say I’d go out of my way to envenom
him. But I do say that I want some light on
this missive, and I’m going to have it. And if anybody
gets hurt in consequence of my sloshing around,
it won’t be my fault. You said you didn’t know
no more about it, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Caruth jumped up, white but vicious looking.
“That’s the third time you’ve asked me that,” he
exploded. “Do you mean to insinuate——”</p>

<p>“Not at all! Not the least bit in the world. I’m
just theologizing. You’ve treated me square, and
I ain’t dangerous to nobody who does that. But I’m
exacerbated over that letter. I wouldn’t mind doing
the ingenuous thing by anybody that helped me to
guess it.”</p>

<p>The frown faded from Caruth’s face, and an expression
of thought took its place. “I’m too much in the
dark to help you much,” he parried.</p>

<p>Without the least hesitation the plainsman thrust
forward the letter. “Maybe this’ll help you,” he
suggested. “This here is a copy. I’ve got the
aboriginal cached where it’ll be safe. But this is all
to the accurate except that it’s got two or three names<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
of places left out. I ain’t givin’ the whole thing away,
you understand.”</p>

<p>Caruth took the letter with a hand that trembled
in spite of himself. He did not want to read it; to
do so seemed a sort of dishonor—a lack of consideration
for the desires of Miss Fitzhugh. On the other
hand, it would be madness to let slip what might very
well be his only chance to acquaint himself with a
letter she had bought and paid for and with facts that
might spell life and death to him and to her.</p>

<p>His uncertainty must have showed in his face, for
the other encouraged him. “Go ’long!” he said.
“Read it. It won’t bite none.”</p>

<p>Caruth opened the letter. It read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Jim</span>:</p>

<p>There’s been a fight and everybody on board is dead or
dying. The <i>Orkney</i> is sinking, and we’re all due to drown
if we live long enough. It was the gold. A million pounds
and more. Petroff told us about it, and we jumped the
officers. They fought hard, but we worried ’em down. Then
the second mate fired the magazine. Petroff and I are fixing a
bottle. We are in the * * * between * * * Get the
gold if you can. No more from</p>

<p class="center">Your Brother</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bill</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Caruth’s hands dropped, and he looked up. His
cheeks were white. So this was the explanation?
The girl’s quest was for gold. The letter she sought
contained, not the names of revolutionists, as he had
inferred, but information as to the whereabouts of
gold that seemed already to have cost many men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
their lives. It all seemed very sordid to Caruth. He
had never earned or lacked a penny in his life, and
to struggle for mere money seemed to him little short
of disgraceful. It speaks volumes for the impression
Marie Fitzhugh had made upon him that it never
even occurred to him to misdoubt her interest in the
matter, or to question whether she might not be a
mere adventuress, the tool of private thieves rather
than the agent of public conspirators. Perhaps,
after all, this was because he was tenacious of his
beliefs, and, once having formed them, did not readily
change.</p>

<p>One thing, however, stood out in his consciousness:
He must discover her whereabouts and tell her that
her letter had been found. He had no qualms in
regard to Wilkins. The man had forced his confidence
upon him, and he was under no obligation to
preserve it. Miss Fitzhugh owned the letter. She
had bought it from its owner and had paid for it,
and was entitled to know its contents. His part
was to find out if she still wanted it, and to make
sure that the man who held it would be available if
she did.</p>

<p>He turned to Wilkins, who had waited patiently
for him to speak. “I can’t help you off-hand,” he
declared, “but perhaps I may be able to do so later.
Perhaps I can trace that letter. I don’t know
whether I can or not, but I will try. Certainly I
can learn something about the wreck of the <i>Orkney</i>,
and that ought to help. Your brother’s room is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
vacant. Suppose you occupy it to-night, and meanwhile
I will see what I can learn. And if I were you,
I should keep that letter to myself.”</p>

<p>The man’s lips curled contemptuously. “Don’t
you worry about me none!” he responded grimly.
“I ain’t takin’ no chances. I’ve had time to arrange
things. Do you know what would eventuate if I
didn’t show up for such and such a time? Well,
I’ll tell you. Copies of this here letter would go to
half a dozen newspapers <i>mucho pronto</i>. An’ I judge
that would queer the game some for the folks that
did for Jim.”</p>

<p>It was this interview that had caused Caruth to
consult Bristow and to tell that clever newspaper
man a great deal more than he had dreamed of doing
when he began, though, for some reason not entirely
intelligible to himself, he did not touch on the arrival
of the Westerner. It was the interview, too, that led
him to the presence of his charmer.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE WOMEN’S HOTEL of New York is
sacred to the unattended woman. The clerks
and the cooks are women; women wait on
the tables; and women convey characteristically
feminine trunks to virgin apartments. No man,
attended or unattended, may spread his name upon
its register, or settle himself within its sacrosanct
precincts. Scarcely may he win permission to wait
in a parlor while a feminine bell-hop carries his card
to the arcana above.</p>

<p>In this parlor Caruth awaited an answer to his
call. Fearing that a card alone might meet denial,
he had inscribed it with the words “On most important
business” before he sent it up.</p>

<p>He had the parlor to himself, and carefully he
chose a position, partly screened by flowering plants,
where he might hope to talk unheard and undisturbed
by any one who might enter. What he had
to say was not too pleasant, and he wanted no
chance eavesdroppers.</p>

<p>He waited a long time—so long, in fact, that he
began to fear that his note might be ineffective, and
he was contemplating a further appeal and wondering,
in the event that this too failed, how long he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
could roost on the steps of the opposite house watching
for her to come out, without being arrested. For
he was determined to see her.</p>

<p>But at last she came.</p>

<p>She wore an evening dress of some glittering
material, rich and black. Her clear-cut profile and
delicately arched eyebrows reminded him of a cameo
or an old French miniature. Her shoulders, rising
from a corsage of black velvet, gleamed like tinted
marble in the soft lights of the hall. It seemed incredible
that she and the girl of a week before could
be the same. He bowed in silence, dumbly staring.</p>

<p>He was recalled to himself by her voice. “Well,
sir,” she reminded him, “you have something to say
to me? Have you forgotten your lines?”</p>

<p>Caruth shook his head. “No,” he answered
slowly; “I had only forgotten my cue. I was thinking
in the fifth act, while we are yet still in the first.
However, you have helped me out. My lines are
these: ‘Your letter has turned up. Wilkins’s brother
called on me to-day with a copy of it.’”</p>

<p>If Caruth intended to startle the girl by his abrupt
announcement, he undoubtedly succeeded. She
grew so white that for a moment he feared she was
about to faint. Then a sparkle came into her eyes.</p>

<p>“His brother?” she repeated. “The one who
wrote the letter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no! Another brother. One who has
been living in the West for years. A typical Westerner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“How did it get into his hands?”</p>

<p>“I can only guess. Probably Wilkins really took
your warning words to heart, for he scribbled a brief
letter on an envelope, and mailed the whole, probably
by the chute in the building. The postmark
shows that the letter was collected about three <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>
that same morning. It went to Denver to the
brother, whose name is Thomas. Thomas dropped
everything and started east. He got here this morning
and came to my rooms to see his brother. He
had heard nothing of the fellow’s death.”</p>

<p>“And he showed you the letter? You have read
it?” The tones were quiet, but Caruth could see
the suspense lurking in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes, he showed it to me. That is, he showed me
a copy of it—with certain words cut out. I have
brought it with me. But before I show it to you, I
must—forgive me—I must be convinced of your
rights in the matter.”</p>

<p>“My rights!”</p>

<p>“Yes, your rights. It seems outrageous for me to
question you; but—I must know.”</p>

<p>“Know what?” A tang of metal grated in the
woman’s words.</p>

<p>“Know all there is to know! I have the right to
ask! You came to my rooms seeking a letter.
You warned Wilkins that the possession of the letter
might be fatal to him. He did not heed you, and he
was murdered within the hour, apparently to get the
letter you wanted so much. To-day I learn that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
letter contains information, not about a political
conspiracy as I had supposed, but about money—money!
I was ready to shield you—even when I
thought you or your accomplices had been guilty of
murder—as long as your acts were political. But
to kill for money—to waylay a man and murder him
for gold—that goes beyond me!”</p>

<p>“And you believe I did that?”</p>

<p>Caruth flushed and paled again. “No!” he stammered.
“Not you. But your friends——”</p>

<p>“My friends are no more guilty than myself. Two
of them were awaiting me, and I thought at first that
they had killed your man. But they did not. I
give you my word that they did not. Neither of
them touched him! He was killed by some one
else.”</p>

<p>“By whom? By whom?”</p>

<p>“Ah, God! I wish I knew!” The woman’s
words were a sob. “Perhaps a chance garroter!
Perhaps—perhaps my enemies! I thought I had
eluded them. I thought they were ignorant that I
was here. But perhaps they knew that I came to
the city that night. Perhaps they followed me.
Perhaps they killed him. I do not know! But it
was done by no friends of mine.”</p>

<p>Caruth drew a long breath. “Thank God for
that! But the money! The money! You threatened
him with death unless he gave up the clue to it——”</p>

<p>“Stop!” The girl’s interjection was swift. “Stop,
Mr. Caruth! I did not threaten him. I warned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
him. I belong to a great organization that is waging
a desperate warfare for the rights of millions of
human beings. We fight as we can. Think for a
moment! You have been free so long—you and
your English forebears—that you take your freedom
as a right. But it did not come as a right.
All of it, <i>all of it</i>, was bought for you at a price.
Every forward step was forced. Every grant from
Magna Charta down was wrested from the king.
Thousands upon thousands of unknown men died
that you might live in peace and freedom, undespoiled.
For a thousand years the path has been
drenched in blood. What right have you—you to
whom freedom came with your first breath; you
who have never known tyranny; you who can
freely assemble and criticise and change your rulers—what
right have you to rebuke us who are just
starting on the same bloody road your fathers trod
for you? Granted that some innocent lives are
taken; granted that some excesses and outrages are
perpetrated in the name of freedom; granted that
some of us go too far and shock your moral sense.
What of it? Think you your ancestors of a thousand
or even a hundred years ago were always calm and
self-contained? Think you they perpetrated no
crimes when they had the power? The world has
grown thin-skinned with prevailing peace, and
shrinks aghast at primitive Russians struggling for
primitive freedom with what weapons they can
grasp. You do not approve our methods! Do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
approve the government’s methods? For every
innocent man whom the terrorists have slain, the
Czar has slain a hundred and imprisoned a thousand.
From the salt mines of the north, from the frozen
steppes, from the purgatory of water-soaked dungeons,
they cry to Heaven. That letter placed in
our hands might have meant—may still mean—the
end of all this. At least, it would hasten the day
when all will end. We did not kill your valet. We
do not know who did. But if we had, what is his
life compared with the lives of millions?”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes flashed; her voice came rich and
strong; like a Judith she stood.</p>

<p>Caruth was awed; almost silenced.</p>

<p>“I do not understand,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“You shall! Although when I tell you I place my
life in your hands. I will tell you the story of the
<i>Orkney</i>. Then you may judge.”</p>

<p>The girl paused to take breath. “In March, two
years ago,” she went on, “the steamship <i>Orkney</i>
sailed from London for St. Petersburg with a million
pounds sterling in gold on board. This gold, borrowed
on the people’s credit, was to be used in
crushing the people. We determined to capture it,
or, if that could not be done, at least to prevent its
reaching Russia. It belonged to the people; the
Czar should not use it to enslave them.</p>

<p>“A war-ship had been sent to bring this gold,
but at the last moment the bureaucrats discovered
that we had gained over the men on board and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
a mutiny was probable. Urgently as it needed the
money, the Russian government dared not send it
by that means. Nor did it dare to send it by rail.
We had inspired a wholesome terror in the hearts
of the ministers of the Czar. At last it hit on the
idea of blackening the gold bars and shipping them
on an ordinary steamer as pig lead to Kronstadt.
A battalion of soldiers would go along, ostensibly
as passengers. So swiftly was this decided on and
carried out, we learned it only at the very last
minute. Had it not been for a lucky chance, we
should not have known it at all. But, as it happened,
two of the soldiers were our men, and we
managed to get orders to them to see that the gold
should never reach its destination. If they could
not throw it into our hands, they were to sink the
vessel and prevent its reaching Russia.</p>

<p>“The <i>Orkney</i> sailed, going north through the
Irish Sea, and around the north end of Scotland.
The war-ship followed her out of the harbor and
hung on her heels persistently, secretly convoying
her. Moreover, Russian agents were watching all
along the route. Our agents, so far as we could
reach them, were also watching.</p>

<p>“Yet the <i>Orkney</i> disappeared. She passed Copenhagen
and entered the Baltic. There on the first
night, at one o’clock in the morning, when near
the opening of the Gulf of Finland, less than three
hundred miles from her destination, her lights went
out. In vain the cruiser tried to find her; in vain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
the various observers strained their eyes. In the
scant hours between one o’clock and daylight she
vanished, gold, crew, vessel, all! Since then, though
Russia has sought incessantly, she has learned
nothing as to her fate. We are certain of this.</p>

<p>“We ourselves know a little—a very little—more.
A fishing boat saw her passing the Upsula Islands
going north into the Gulf of Bothnia. The news
came to us and not to the Government.</p>

<p>“Except this, we knew nothing until two weeks
ago. Then a friend sent us a bottle he had found
floating in the Baltic. It contained a message from
the dead. It told us how well our men had done
their work. It said in brief that the writer and his
friends had risen and attacked the officers. Bitter
fighting had followed. The stokers, imprisoned
below, kept the fires up and the ship moved slowly
but steadily northward. A storm arose. Our men
made a rush and gained control. But at the moment
of victory one of the officers exploded some powder
that was on board, and the ship began to sink.
Nearly everybody was dead or dying by that time,
and all that our agent could do was to drive the
vessel ashore. Just before she sank he must have
thrown overboard the bottle with his message. He
had done his duty well and patriotically; his name
will be honored when the Russian people come to
their own.</p>

<p>“In one thing alone he failed. The part of his
letter that told just where the <i>Orkney</i> sank was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
blotted out. We can infer only that she sank on the
coast of Finland, the Russian side of the Gulf of
Bothnia; that she is lying somewhere within a stretch
of one hundred and fifty or at the most two hundred
miles. She must have sunk intact without breaking
up, for no wreckage has come ashore from her.
Somewhere at the bottom of that water she is lying
with her gold.”</p>

<p>Miss Fitzhugh paused. Her eyes were sparkling
and her cheeks flushed. Thrilling as was her tale,
Caruth came near not heeding it through looking
at her. The charm of the teller nearly effaced the
interest of the tale.</p>

<p>After a while the girl went on.</p>

<p>“And now, Mr. Caruth, you know all. I have put
myself wholly in your hands. A word from you to
the Russian authorities and I shall be an exile from
my native land, proscribed, with a price on my head.
If I go back and am caught, I shall rot in the dungeons
of St. Peter and St. Paul. I am not afraid.
I faced the risk when I entered on this work. I
knew that sooner or later I must be caught; that
permanent escape could come only from the advent
of freedom before fate overtook me. I took the
risk, and I will pay the penalty without whining if
the need comes. But I wish to do something to aid
my country before that time. Hitherto I have been
able to do but little. I bear a great name. Fitzhugh
is my mother’s name—not my father’s. I am reputed
wealthy, but I have no real power over my money.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
My fortune is in the hands of a guardian who is
loyal to the Czar, and who watches me narrowly.
In his grip I am held powerless. I am only a woman.
I cannot fight with my hands. I can only use my
wits. You reproach me because I am contending
for gold. Can you conceive what this gold will do
for our cause? What a mighty lever it will be in
our hands? For we are poor—<i>poor!</i> If I can put
this money in the hands of the Brotherhood, I shall
have done more than I ever hoped to do. Then let
the bureaucrats lay me by the heels and I will laugh
in their faces, content to die.”</p>

<p>Abruptly the girl stopped; and then went on with
an entire change of tone. “Now, Mr. Caruth,” she
said, “you know all. What will you do? Will you
betray me or aid me? Choose!”</p>

<p>The girl’s breath came fast between her parted
lips. Her eyes shone starlike. Her bosom rose and
fell tumultuously. “What will you do?” she demanded.
“Choose!”</p>

<p>Caruth’s face glowed. “Do!” he cried. “Is
there anything I will not do? I did not know that
women such as you lived. I am wholly in your
hands. Ask of me what you will: Money—risk—life—anything!
In life and in death I am yours!”</p>

<p>Passionately he stretched out his arms and drew
the girl forward. She swayed toward him and for an
instant he held her against his madly beating heart.
“I love you!” he cried. “I love you! I love you!”</p>

<p>It was for an instant only, for, with a strength of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
which he had not thought her capable, the girl tore
herself free.</p>

<p>“For shame!” she gasped. “For shame!”</p>

<p>Caruth made no attempt to move.</p>

<p>“Why ‘for shame’?” he questioned. “I love
you. I have loved you from the first moment I saw
you. Within an hour from that first moment I lied
for you! I risked the electric chair for you! I did
it willingly, gladly, without being asked. I would
do it again! I love you! Miss Fitzhugh—Marie—will
you be my wife?”</p>

<p>A curious expression came into the girl’s face.
“What!” she demanded incredulously. “You
would marry me? Me! The woman who came to
your rooms at midnight? The woman whom you
suspected of murder? The adventuress who plots
for gold? You would marry me?”</p>

<p>“You and none other. Is it so strange? Many
men must have loved you! Every one who saw you
must have loved you.”</p>

<p>“But not under such circumstances as these. Mr.
Caruth, all my life I shall be grateful to you. As
long as I live, I shall remember your words. They
will console me when my dark hour comes, as
come it must for each of our Brotherhood. But I
cannot accept. I am pledged to a cause which I
cannot desert. No, Mr. Caruth! Go back to your
safe and harmless American life and forget me. It
would be ill requital for your kindness to draw you
further into my fated existence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Caruth stretched out his hand and took hers.
She did not resist, but her fingers lay cold in his
and she shook her head slowly, smiling wanly.
“No,” she breathed. “No.”</p>

<p>Caruth’s grasp did not slacken. “Why not?” he
questioned. “This matter of the <i>Orkney</i> will not
last forever. When it is over, you will have earned
your freedom; you will have done a great work for
your country. Then——”</p>

<p>The girl did not pretend to misunderstand him.
“It cannot be,” she murmured, and there was a
world of sadness in her tones.</p>

<p>“Why not? Is it because you don’t care for me?”</p>

<p>“No, not that!”</p>

<p>“Then——”</p>

<p>The girl flung up her arms. “Oh!” she cried.
“Can’t you understand? I shall never marry,
or, if I do, it will be at the behest of the Brotherhood.
I shall marry some one who is helping to set
Russia free. Perhaps—perhaps I may buy some
part of her freedom with the only pawn I possess—myself.
I am not free—I never will be free till
Russia is.”</p>

<p>Caruth drew a long breath. “You mean to sell
yourself?” he questioned gently.</p>

<p>The girl flushed redly. “It is for the people,” she
pleaded.</p>

<p>“Then”—Caruth’s voice rang out—“then sell
yourself to me. I can take risks as well as another.
I am rich, young, strong. All that I have is at your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
service. Let me help. Tell me what to do, and it
shall be done. I’ll drag this <i>Orkney</i> up from the
sea. If you are for sale, let me bid! And if I pay
the price—if I win back the gold from the sea—then
let me claim my reward.”</p>

<p>But the girl shook her head. “I will not!” she
cried. “I was wrong to let you become involved
in this. But I did not know you then. Now that I
do know you I shall not let you take chances such
as these.”</p>

<p>“I take them very willingly.”</p>

<p>“Because you do not gauge them. Or no, I do
not mean that—I believe you would take them even
if you understood what you were facing. But it is
not fair to let you.”</p>

<p>Caruth laughed. “I’m the best judge of that!”
he declared. “Come, we won’t discuss it any more.
I am going to help you, and that’s all there is to it.”
Gently he raised the girl’s hand to his lips. “There!”
he announced, as he released it. “It’s all settled.
I won’t bother you about it any more till that gold
is in our hands. Come, sit down, and tell me what
you want me to do first.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“There are no buts. You want to know about
this Wilkins who has turned up. Very well. I’ll
tell you what I noticed, and you can ask questions.”</p>

<p>Before Caruth left the hotel that night, he had
imparted to Miss Fitzhugh every detail concerning
the plainsman that his quickened memory could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
supply. The man’s appearance, his language,
history, desires, threats, and the precautions he had
taken to secure his safety, had all been minutely
depicted. Miss Fitzhugh possessed the rare power
of making those she questioned recall particulars
that had made almost no impression on them when
they occurred. Just as a powerful developer brings
out on a photographic plate once invisible details,
so her interrogatories, acting on Caruth’s memory,
quickened it and evolved details concerning Thomas
Wilkins that the young man himself had not suspected
that he possessed.</p>

<p>At the end the girl had dismissed him with instructions
to bring the plainsman to call upon her the
next day.</p>

<p>Caruth hesitated. “He seems to be a very sharp
fellow,” he objected. “He put two and two together
very quickly, and asked some questions that worried
me. Undoubtedly he thinks my story fishy. And
it is fishy. If he knows that you are involved in the
case, he may become dangerous.”</p>

<p>The woman threw out her hands. “Don’t I know
it?” she flamed. “But I’ve got to see him for myself.
How do either you or I know that he is your valet’s
brother? How do we know that he is not an agent
of the man who killed your valet? Russia has many
spies as improbable as he. Probably he is what he
purports to be, but I must see him and judge for
myself. And I must see that letter—the whole of it.
There is no other way. Somebody must do the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
bargaining. No, I must see him. Do you know
where to find him?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. He is asleep in his brother’s room
at my apartment now.”</p>

<p>“Then have him ready at ten to-morrow morning.
Be at the door of your building at the moment,
neither too soon nor too late. A motor will pick you
up and take you to a safe place where I will
meet you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the clock struck ten the next morning, Caruth,
with Tom Wilkins at his heels, stepped
from the elevator in the Chimneystack Building
and walked to the great entrance. Just as he
reached it a red automobile drew up at the curb.
Caruth motioned Wilkins into it, and jumped in
behind him; and before he had time even to take
his seat the machine was off. Caruth, glancing back
expectantly, was somewhat surprised to see that his
hasty departure had apparently roused no interest.
The spies in attendance, if spies there were, either
did not care to follow or recognized the hopelessness
of attempting to do so.</p>

<p>After racing northward for several blocks, the
motor turned into a side street, ran east past two
or three streets, and, once more turning, sped downtown,
finally stopping at the ladies’ entrance of one
of the big Broadway hotels.</p>

<p>Caruth laughed to himself as he got out. Anything
less like the mysterious Nihilistic rendezvous
at which he had expected to land could scarcely be
conceived. Still less excitement remained in the
venture when, after sending up his card by a very
matter-of-fact bell-boy, the two were shown into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
parlor and allowed to wait for a very characteristically
feminine interval.</p>

<p>If the plainsman felt out of place in surroundings
which must have been wholly new to him, at least
he did not show it. His face was as expressionless
as a poker player’s, and he carried himself as if he
owned the place, seemingly unconscious of his ill-fitting,
ready-made clothing, and of the heavy boots
that clattered loudly on the polished floors.</p>

<p>Caruth had told him little as to the object of their
visit, merely saying that the lady on whom they were
to call had something to say that might throw light
on the object of his search. Wilkins had asked no
questions. His small, furtive eyes had rested for a
moment on the younger man’s face, and then he had
nodded. “I’m your potato,” he remarked.</p>

<p>Miss Fitzhugh kept the two waiting for a time
which seemed long to the plainsman, unused as he
was to the intricacies of the feminine toilet. When
she swept in at last, her appearance made both men
catch their breath, Caruth not less than the unsophisticated
Westerner.</p>

<p>Dressed entirely in black, high-throated, and with
her hair arranged with severe plainness, she looked
years older and more sedate than the magnificently
vital creature Caruth had before seen. In her eyes
lay a look of slumbering sorrow which persisted even
when she smiled. Caruth, amazed, wondered what
facet of her kaleidoscopic nature would manifest
itself next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>But if her appearance bewildered Caruth, it
absolutely overwhelmed Wilkins. He dropped his
hat, stammered, and almost gasped at sight of her.
When she gave him her hand, he seemed afraid to
touch it.</p>

<p>But this phase passed. Miss Fitzhugh had a way
with her—whether inborn or acquired it might be
hard to guess—that was most effective in dealing
with the opposite sex. Within ten minutes, Wilkins,
his errand forgotten, was telling her a story of his
experiences as a sheep-herder. “Yes, ma’am,” he
wound up. “Muttons are all right when they’re
served with mint sauce or when they’ve been cropped
to furnish trouserings, but for steady company
they’re about on the level of a Boston tea party.
When you’ve watched ’em masticating daisies for
a few spaces, you begin to yearn for something that
don’t look like it had come out of a Noah’s ark.”</p>

<p>Miss Fitzhugh smiled sympathetically. “So
when you got your brother’s letter, with its promise
of millions, you were glad enough to hurry east,”
she suggested. “You wanted some of the fleshpots
of Egypt.”</p>

<p>Wilkins hesitated. “No’m,” he answered uncertainly.
“I ain’t caring much about no foreign
grub; chile con carne is good enough for me. But,
of course, if there’s any chance of strikin’ a pocket
and dredgin’ a million or so out of that ship, I’d like
to do it. And, of course, I’d like to do up the fellows
that did for Jim.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>Miss Fitzhugh stared at him questioningly. “There
is a chance of doing it,” she answered meaningly;
“but it isn’t as easy as you may suppose. You may
have to fight for it.”</p>

<p>Wilkins’s right hand wandered back to his hip-pocket,
reappearing with a huge revolver, while the
other hand suddenly became possessed of a great
knife. “I’m heeled,” he responded grimly.</p>

<p>Miss Fitzhugh showed no surprise. Deliberately
she took the revolver from the plainsman’s hand
and with practised fingers twirled the cylinder and
drew back the hammer, smiling at the man’s warning
exclamation. “I’m used to them,” she explained.</p>

<p>She handed back the weapon and went on. “Your
brother’s ship was the <i>Orkney</i>, Mr. Wilkins. It
sailed from Liverpool March 5, nearly two years
ago, and was wrecked somewhere in the Baltic four
days later. It had on board more than a million
pounds sterling—nearly five million dollars. That
money really belongs to me and my friends, though
it is claimed by others who have been moving heaven
and earth to get it. Your brother who wrote the
letter had no right to any part of it. Your brother
who was murdered had no right to it. You have no
right to it. But we are very generous to our friends.
It is really impossible that you should get this gold
yourself. You will have to call either on us or on
our enemies to help you. If your letter proves
valuable and enables us to get it—to get our own
money, mind you—we will share it with you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>The plainsman’s eyes narrowed, and his mouth
changed to a straight slit above his chin. For the
first time Caruth noticed his likeness to the dead
man. This was business, and accordingly Wilkins
promptly relegated sentiment to the background.
“How big a share?” he demanded roughly.</p>

<p>“Well——” Miss Fitzhugh hesitated. “First let
me explain,” she went on at last. “The <i>Orkney</i> was
wrecked in the Baltic Sea about three thousand miles
from here. We shall have to charter a steamer and
seek for her. Your letter may or may not enable us to
find her. If we do find her, we will have to send
down divers and bring the gold up—not a very easy
task, I imagine. The search will have to be made
secretly, for our foes are watchful and able. We
may have to fight to save both the gold and ourselves
after or before we get it on board. The whole trip
will cost money—a great deal of money. It will
strain our resources to the utmost—and it may come
to nothing in the end. We need the money—need
it desperately. Now, considering all this, what do
you think will be a fair share for your aid?”</p>

<p>Wilkins considered. His small eyes wandered
from Miss Fitzhugh to Caruth and back again, but
his impassive face gave no clue to the thoughts that
were passing in his mind. The others believed that
he was calculating how large a share he could demand.
Long afterwards, they suspected that his
ideas had been very different.</p>

<p>“Well,” he declared, at last, “I don’t mean no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
officiousness. Maybe you’re givin’ it to me straight.
But I reckon the other side would have about as
good a yarn to tell, and maybe it would have more
money to pay with. I guess this money don’t belong
to either of you. If it did, you wouldn’t be so durned
mysterious about it. I reckon you’re both out to
steal it. But, h——l! that don’t make no difference
to me. I’ll steal just as soon as any other <i>hombre</i>
will, if he can steal enough to make it worth while
and can get away with the goods. Now, let’s talk
straight. Who are your fellows, any way?”</p>

<p>Miss Fitzhugh hesitated, but only for a moment.
After all, it was better to tell this plain-spoken
frontiersman what he wanted to know rather than
to have him make inquiries that might perhaps
come to the ears of the Russian government and
lead to the betrayal of the whole plan. If he were
really a traitor or a spy all was lost anyhow. He
could ruin everything by telling what he already
knew in the right quarter; he could do no worse if
he knew more. Perhaps he might be forced to hold
his tongue by fear, although this did not seem very
probable. However, it was neck or nothing.</p>

<p>She leaned forward. “Did you ever hear of the
Russian revolutionists, Mr. Wilkins?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Them fellows that are tryin’ to knock the Czar
into the middle of a puddle duckski? Sure! They’re
all right, if they’d only talk less like a seidlitz powder.”</p>

<p>“I am a member of the inner circle of the Brotherhood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
This gold belongs to us. It was borrowed
on our credit by the Russian Government. We tried
to take it from them, and we succeeded, but lost it
in the moment of success. We need it to help the
cause of freedom—to get for our people the freedom
that you have as a birthright. We are trying to get
it back. Your letter may enable us to do so. Will
you help us?”</p>

<p>Wilkins nodded. “I reckon so,” he responded.
“What’ll they do to us if they catch us?”</p>

<p>“Do!” The girl laughed harshly. “I don’t
know. Shoot us, hang us, drown us, or jail us for
life. Are you afraid?”</p>

<p>“No’m! Not to say afraid. But I always like
to know what I’m goin’ up against. Buckin’ the
Czar looks to me a good deal like going against a
phony faro game. But, thunder! I always was
willing to take a sporting chance. I’ll go you for
one-tenth of what we get. I guess that’s fair.”</p>

<p>Miss Fitzhugh nodded slowly. “That’s a good
deal,” she remarked, “considering that we take all
the risks. But I accept. One-tenth of all we recover
shall be yours. You shall go with us and help us to
get it, and you shall have your share. Here’s my
hand on it.”</p>

<p>Awkwardly the plainsman took the smooth, slim
fingers which she stretched out to him. “It’s a
whack, ma’am,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s a ‘whack’! But, Mr. Wilkins, there is
something more that I want to say, and I want you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
to understand that I say it not as a threat, but simply
as a warning. I don’t know how much you may
know of our society, but it has representatives all
over the world, and it does not tolerate traitors.
No one who has ever betrayed it has lived long.
If either you or Mr. Caruth here tried to play
fast and loose with it, you might succeed for the
moment, but it would be for a moment only.
Your heirs might profit by your treachery, but you
would not.”</p>

<p>Wilkins laughed. He seemed neither offended nor
worried by the girl’s words. “Sure!” he answered
cheerfully. “That’s understood. No gang can hold
together or be successful unless they does for anybody
that splits on ’em. I ain’t boastin’ none of my
whiteness. Maybe I’d sell out if I thought it would
pay me; but, naturally, I count myself some better
than the State of New Jersey. I ain’t offerin’ myself
for sale promiscuous desultory. And in this case
it don’t look as if it would be altogether healthy to
sell out. No! You can count on me as long as you
play fair yourselves. Now, what’s the program?”</p>

<p>Miss Fitzhugh leaned back in her chair with an
expression of relief on her face. “I believe you are
truer than you say, Mr. Wilkins,” she murmured.
“I’m going to trust you. As to the program, I must
consider. The first thing is to let me look at that
letter.”</p>

<p>“Sure!” Without hesitation, the plainsman
handed over a folded sheet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>Miss Fitzhugh only glanced at it. “I mean the
original,” she explained, with a steely glint in her
eyes.</p>

<p>But Wilkins shook his head decidedly. “Not
any,” he replied. “The aboriginal is safe, and I
don’t show it to no one yet aways. It tells where
the <i>Orkney</i>’s sunk, all right, and I’ll go with you and
guide you till we get somewhere near. I’ve been
lookin’ up the place on the map, and I can do it.
Or I’ll tell you: I’ll show you the letter as soon as
we get into the Baltic? How’ll that do?”</p>

<p>“It won’t do at all. The letter may be valueless,
and——”</p>

<p>“It ain’t valueless. It tells, all right. It says
‘in a narrow strait between this island and that
island.’ You needn’t worry about that part of it.”</p>

<p>The woman hesitated. Was all this a cunningly
devised plot of the Czar’s agents or was the man
honest? His refusal to disclose his secret was not
unnatural, and yet——</p>

<p>“Mr. Wilkins,” she said slowly, “I’ll take your
word for it, since I can do nothing else. But I warn
you solemnly that if I fail in this thing after I have
spent all the money that I shall have to spend, it
will cost both you and me our lives. The Brotherhood
will not tolerate such a costly failure as this
would be. So beware.”</p>

<p>Wilkins nodded. “Shoot,” he said. “You’re
faded.”</p>

<p>Miss Fitzhugh looked slightly bewildered. “Very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
well,” she said. “On your head be it. Now we
must see about getting a ship.”</p>

<p>“A ship!” Caruth leaned forward. All through
the conversation he had lain back in his chair,
listening but not uttering a single word. The girl
seemed entirely competent to manage things, and
he felt no call to intervene, though he shivered once
or twice when she spoke so openly to this plainsman,
who frankly confessed that he was ready to play
traitor for a sufficiently large reward. But his chance
had come around at last.</p>

<p>“A ship!” he echoed. “Don’t worry about that.
I have a thousand-ton yacht eating its head off down
the bay. I’ll be delighted if you will use it as your
own. When shall we sail?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER NINE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PROFESSOR SHISHKIN spent the next ten
days after Maxime’s cataclysmal visit in
worrying over what he had to do and in trying
to devise some way of eluding at least that part of
his orders that required him to take Olga with him.
Knowing the methods of the Brotherhood, he guessed
that, if need be, they would not hesitate to use the girl
in accomplishing their ends, at whatever peril to her.
On the other hand, he was resolved that she should
never go back to Russia. But how to avoid the necessity
he could not see. He worried himself sick over it.</p>

<p>He was in this state of mind when Marie Fitzhugh
notified him by the long-distance telephone—for she
did not wish to be seen in his company or at his
house—to send the notice of his impending departure
on Mr. Caruth’s yacht to the papers, and to be ready
to sail in four days.</p>

<p>It was not difficult to get the announcement
printed. The Professor’s scientific achievements,
while they had never brought him wealth, had
brought him the homage of the intellectual of all
lands. He had even been discovered by the New
York Sunday papers and had had his achievements
attractively described in a syndicate letter written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
by a special writer, who criticised—and disproved—the
Professor’s famous theory of rising sea-floors
by the sole light of information derived from the
books of the Professor himself.</p>

<p>In spite of this, the Professor was a friend to newspaper
men, and was always willing to be interviewed
on almost any subject connected with his work. So
when he desired to give out the news of his coming
trip, he had only to choose to which newspaper
friend he would send it.</p>

<p>Finally he picked out Bristow, for much the same
reasons that had led Caruth to consult that well-informed
individual. He had first met the reporter
on his arrival from a trip to Europe several years
before, and had been attracted to him by the able
and intelligent account which the reporter had printed
concerning certain scientific discoveries he had made
on his trip. This good impression was confirmed
on several later occasions. Further, the reporter
naturally occurred to him, because that young man
had recently become a somewhat constant caller
at the New Jersey cottage. (The Professor was
slightly bewildered by his apparent assiduity in the
pursuit of science, but did not suspect that his
daughter might have something to do with it.)
Further, as ship-news reporter for the Consolidated
Press, Bristow was not only the exact man to handle
such an item, but was best adapted to give it the
wide publicity desired by its publication in the papers
served by that great news organization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>Bristow put the item “on the wires,” and then
hurried down to East Orange at the first possible
moment. He did not, however, go straight to the
Professor himself, but to that gentleman’s daughter.
Moreover, he addressed her as Olga, from which it
might be suspected that matters had progressed
further than the Professor imagined.</p>

<p>“Olga,” he began, “this note—what does it
mean?”</p>

<p>The girl glanced at the paper in his hand. “I
don’t know,” she answered thoughtfully. “I don’t
know.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Ten days ago a young man came to see father.
They talked together a long time. Father was a
good deal excited; I could hear his voice away upstairs.
Since then he has been ill. He cannot rest.
He never laughs or even smiles. He has grown
nervous and irritable. Always he is puzzling over
something. He is killing himself. Yesterday he had
me write you that note telling of his coming trip.
I have begged him not to go, but he is quite determined.
He says he wants to confirm his sea-floor
theory.”</p>

<p>“But he is too old!”</p>

<p>“Of course! But he insists that he must go. Yet
I don’t believe he wants to. I believe something or
somebody is forcing him—though I don’t understand
how any one can. Do you?”</p>

<p>Bristow looked thoughtful. Caruth’s association<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
with the affair, as announced in the notice sent to the
papers, caused him to conclude inevitably that the
forthcoming trip had some connection with the arrival
of the fair but mysterious Russian and with the murder
of the valet. He could not quite understand the
object, however, being ignorant of the <i>Orkney</i> and
her fate, as well as of the recovery of the missing letter.</p>

<p>“How does Mr. Caruth come to be in this?” he
asked abruptly, wondering what excuse had been
offered for the young man’s sudden interest in affairs
scientific.</p>

<p>“Mr. Caruth? Father seems to have known his
father, and Mr. Caruth, knowing that father wanted
to go to the Baltic, offered his yacht. At least, that’s
what they say,” concluded the girl. “For my part,
I don’t believe it. Do you?”</p>

<p>Bristow hesitated. “No,” he answered, at last.
“I happen to know that it is at least partly untrue.
But, Olga, don’t express any doubt publicly. I
suspect this is a big thing, and indiscreet talking
would probably play hob with a good many people,
including the Professor. What is your part in this,
Olga? Do you go with him?”</p>

<p>The girl nodded. “Of course,” she answered
readily. “He says he wants me to, and of course I
can’t let him go alone. And yet, do you know, Joe,
I don’t believe he really wants me to go at all?”</p>

<p>The reporter nodded slowly. The skein was still
too tangled for him to unravel, but he was studying
it intently. “Why go?” he asked. “Olga, I don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
want to be selfish. I have waited a long time, and
I was prepared to keep on waiting as long as I could
see you from time to time. But I can’t let you go
away from me this way, especially to Russia. Why
not marry me at once? Then I can speak to your
father from a different footing. Perhaps I can persuade
him to give up the trip.”</p>

<p>“If you only could! But——”</p>

<p>Bristow thought she was yielding and pushed
his advantage. “Olga dear!” he urged. “Come
to me.” He took the girl in his arms, and she gazed
up into his face with the expression that a woman
wears for one man only. “If I could, Joe,” she
murmured. “If I only could! But I can’t; you
know I can’t. Father would go alone, and I should
never forgive myself.”</p>

<p>For a moment the reporter held her, looking
tenderly into her blue eyes; then he released her.
“Well,” he said briskly, “that settles it. I must talk
to the Professor. I suppose he is in his laboratory?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“All right. I won’t be longer than I can help.
Wait for me.”</p>

<p>When Bristow entered the laboratory, he found
the Professor pacing up and down the room in a
state of suppressed excitement. When he recognized
his visitor, he strove to greet him calmly, but despite
himself his irritation shone through.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bristow!” he exclaimed. “You’ve come
about my note, I suppose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“Yes; that and——”</p>

<p>“I have nothing more to say. I told it all in the
note. I am going to the Baltic to get proof of my
theory about sea-floors. I am going on the yacht
of Mr. Caruth, a young scientific friend of mine.
That is all. I can’t discuss it further.”</p>

<p>The reporter concealed his dismay. Olga had
certainly not exaggerated the old man’s condition.
He had aged markedly since Bristow had last seen
him. He was burning himself out. It occurred to
the reporter that the conspirators—for he did not
doubt that there was a conspiracy—had better be
careful or the Professor would not live to carry out
their wishes, whatever these might be.</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Professor,” he answered. “But I
want to talk to you about something else. Won’t you
ask me to sit down?” He moved a chair up beside
the old man’s accustomed seat, and stood waiting.</p>

<p>Professor Shishkin hesitated for an instant. Then
the demands of courtesy had their way. “I’m sorry,”
he muttered. “I’m not myself. I’m an old man,
and I grow forgetful. Sit down, Mr. Bristow. I’m
very glad to see you. Ask me what you will.”</p>

<p>“Even unto the half of your kingdom?” queried
the reporter. “I want more than that, Professor.
I want Miss Olga!”</p>

<p>“Olga!” The Professor half rose. “What do
you mean?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“I mean that I want to marry her,” returned
Bristow. The people who called Bristow cheeky<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
would not have known him. His heart was thumping
painfully, and his color came and went, though he
managed to keep his features calm. “We love each
other, and we want to marry.”</p>

<p>For a moment Professor Shishkin stared at the
young man. Then he burst into a fit of laughter
that made the reporter look at him in amazement.</p>

<p>But, unheeding, the Professor cackled on as if
he would never stop. His shrunken form fairly
shook with merriment that rapidly grew hysterical.
So long it continued that Bristow forgot his own
excited feelings and grew anxious.</p>

<p>At last the old man calmed himself. “I beg your
pardon, Mr. Bristow,” he quavered. “I beg your
pardon. I was very discourteous. I was not laughing
at you, but at the way things come about. What
creatures of fate we all are! We think we control
events, but events really control us! Mr. Bristow,
I have been worrying myself sick about Olga, and
here you come, pat to the moment, to set everything
straight. You say that Olga loves you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” The reporter’s voice was hushed and
reverent.</p>

<p>“Then everything is all right. I shall be delighted
to have her marry you. But I must impose some
conditions.”</p>

<p>The Professor’s voice had grown stronger. Years
seemed to have fallen from his shoulders. Bristow
stared at him in wonder.</p>

<p>“Anything you like,” he stammered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Shishkin smiled. “Oh, it won’t be hard on you,”
he promised. “Though you may find my conditions
difficult to understand. Let me explain. I am compelled
to go on this trip concerning which I have
written you. I am compelled to take Olga with
me—or to appear to do so. I don’t want to take her,
but I cannot refuse openly. But no one acquainted
with her will be on the vessel. If I can find a substitute
who resembles her somewhat, no one is likely
to detect the change. The trouble has been to get
Olga’s consent and to hide her away while I was
gone. Your proposal makes this easy.”</p>

<p>Amazedly the reporter listened. The old man
was showing a new phase of character—a phase
novel to Bristow, who had always thought of him
only as an aged scientist engrossed in matters far
removed from worldly scheming. But then, neither
had he ever thought of him in connection with
Russian terrorism, in which it now seemed that he
was involved. Breathlessly, yet delighted at his
easy success, he waited for the old man to continue.</p>

<p>Professor Shishkin did not keep him waiting long.
“Now,” he went on, “my consent to your marriage
to Olga is conditional on this. You must find some
one who reasonably resembles Olga, and who is
willing for a consideration to go with me in her
place. You must bring her here the night before
we sail. I will have an old minister friend of mine
waiting. He can marry you and Olga. Then Olga
and the substitute will change clothes. When you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
take Olga away, the substitute can remain. She
can wear a veil as long as any one who knows Olga
is likely to see her. Once on the yacht, we will be
safe from detection.”</p>

<p>Bristow gasped. Scarcely could he believe his
ears. The Professor had taken to intrigue as if he
had been dabbling in it all his life. What next?</p>

<p>“But,” he questioned, “where can I find a substitute?
Do you know of any one like Olga——”</p>

<p>“Dozens of them. Hundreds of girls in New
York resemble her more or less. Olga is of a very
common type.”</p>

<p>The reporter flushed angrily. He did not think
Olga of a common type. To him there was no one
like her. Still, he could scarcely quarrel with her
father for saying so.</p>

<p>“It won’t be as easy as you think,” he returned.
“Still, it might be done.”</p>

<p>“It must be done. Otherwise Olga must go with
me. A power stronger than I decrees it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, in that event—let me think!” The
reporter was beginning to enter into the spirit of the
thing. “I believe I know the very girl you want.
She’s doing a turn at Weser’s Music Hall. She does
look like Olga in a general sort of way.”</p>

<p>“An actress?” questioned the Professor.</p>

<p>“Humph! Well, she calls herself one, and I guess
we’ll let it go at that. I’ve known her for a good
while, though never very well, and I believe she’s
straight. That’s her reputation, anyhow. I do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
believe that by making-up a little she could pass for
Olga with people who didn’t know her well.”</p>

<p>“That is all that is necessary. So long as she has
the right height and figure, and bears a general
resemblance to Olga, no one will question her identity
if I introduce her as my daughter. Oh, yes! It will
be easy. Where can I see this girl?”</p>

<p>Bristow looked at his watch. “She’ll be at the
theatre now,” he announced. “I’ll hurry up to town
and catch her as she comes out, and arrange——”</p>

<p>“Never mind. I’ll go with you and see her at
once. There is no time to lose.” The Professor
rose. “Remember, Mr. Bristow,” he added seriously:
“this is no pleasure masquerade. It may
easily become a matter of life and death for me, for
Olga, and for others. I do not tell you more because
I am sworn not to do so, and because the less you
know the better; but don’t think for a moment that
this is anything but deadly earnest. Now, let us go.”</p>

<p>Bristow rose. “Certainly,” he agreed. “But
hadn’t we better speak to Olga first?”</p>

<p>The Professor looked puzzled. “To Olga?
Why?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“Well, she might conceivably object. Women
don’t always look at things from the same point of
view as men.”</p>

<p>The Professor hesitated; then he waved his hand
indifferently. “Perhaps you are right,” he admitted.
“But Olga must agree. Seriously, this is the only
means of saving her life and mine.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BRISTOW and the Professor had been waiting
at the stage door for only a few minutes when
men and women, singly or in twos or threes,
began to dribble through the gates and lose themselves
in the homeward-bound crowds.</p>

<p>“Miss Lee will be out here in a minute now,
Professor,” observed the reporter. “See if you can
pick her out. If you can, it will be a sort of a test
as to her resemblance to Olga. If you can’t, I’ll
show you.”</p>

<p>The Professor nodded. Years seemed to have
fallen from his shoulders. “Very well,” he agreed
cheerfully.</p>

<p>No misgivings as to the girl’s acceptance of his
offer troubled him. His idea was to offer her a trip
to Europe, abundant fine clothes, reasonable money,
and the chance to play lady for a few months among
cultured people, and to ask in return only that she
should pass as his daughter. Concerning the risks
of the trip, he intended to say nothing, feeling confident
that there would be no risk for her. Even if
the worst came to the worst and he himself went to
a Russian prison—which seemed unlikely—he could
not conceive how she could come to harm, his desire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
to leave Olga behind being based on very different
reasons. Offering everything, and asking only
a service that was in itself a pleasure, Professor
Shishkin could not see how any girl could hesitate.
All of which shows that he was not familiar with
certain temptations which every handsome working
girl and especially every actress in the great city had
long been schooled to resist.</p>

<p>At last she came, and he picked her out instantly.
The likeness to Olga was striking, though the differences
were so great that no one who really knew
either girl would be at all likely to mistake her for
the other. With Bristow at his side, he started
forward.</p>

<p>Miss Lee might fairly be called a type. From
her high-ratted pompadour, past her exaggerated
straight-front, to the flare at the bottom of her cheap
skirt, she was dressed in the style. Neat as a cherry
blossom, she carried herself with a dash that the
Professor found himself mentally approving. A
spot of red burned in either cheek, and her eyes
snapped as she stepped upon the street. A student
of the sex would have declared that she was in a
royal rage.</p>

<p>The Professor was not a connoisseur in women,
however, and he did not suspect that Miss Lee had
just been “called down” by the stage manager for
being late in answering her call, and had been told
in no uncertain terms that if she was late again she
could stay away for good. Miss Lee had glared at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
the stage manager, but had not answered back.
Twelve dollars a week may not be much to some
people, but when it is one’s sole support, one is
likely to think twice before casting it away. Having
held her tongue, Miss Lee was in the condition of an
engine on which the safety valve is tied down. She
trembled on the verge of an explosion.</p>

<p>Ignorant of this, the Professor and Bristow stepped
in the girl’s way and raised their hats.</p>

<p>“How do you do, Miss Lee?” remarked the latter.
“I want to introduce to you my friend, Professor
Shishkin. He wants to talk to you on a very important
subject.”</p>

<p>If the girl was startled, she did not show it.
“Gee!” she exclaimed, with pretended lightness,
glancing at the Professor’s venerable aspect.
“What’s broke loose? Has me long lost uncle
cashed in and left his money to his darling brother’s
offspring?”</p>

<p>The Professor did not quite follow. “No-o,” he
quavered slowly. “I wanted to see you on a personal
matter. I have been studying your appearance, and
I——”</p>

<p>“Oh! Ain’t you ashamed? And you so old, too!
Fade away!”</p>

<p>“My dear young lady!” The Professor did not
understand what the girl meant, but he gathered
that she was reproving him. “My dear young lady!
It is because I am so old that I venture to address
you. As I say, I have been studying your appearance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
and I want to talk with you quietly. If you
will go with me to——”</p>

<p>Miss Lee flushed. “Ain’t you the frisky grandpop!”
she demanded scornfully. “Back to the
bald-headed row for yours. You mashers make
me tired. Gee! I’ll have to take to eating onions
to keep you off. I take it right hard that you should
let me in for this, Mr. Bristow. You know I ain’t
that sort.”</p>

<p>Bristow had been listening in secret amusement,
but at the girl’s protest he started forward. “It’s
all right, Miss Lee!” he said. “The Professor really
wants to talk to you on business. He is to be my
father-in-law, and I wouldn’t think of encouraging
him in any capers. He’s no masher.”</p>

<p>“Masher!” At last the Professor understood.
“Good heavens!” he exclaimed. “Do you take
me for one of those vapid fools that exhibit themselves
on the street corners? I should have thought my
white hair would have shielded me from such an
imputation. After all, however, it may be natural
enough. I suppose I began wrong. But I am not
that kind. Without denying your evident attractions,
young lady, I assure you that I have sought you for
a very different reason. This is strictly business.
I can’t talk here. Perhaps”—an idea struck the
Professor—“perhaps you will do me the honor of
dining with me at some place near here—any place
you like to name!”</p>

<p>For some moments the girl stared at him shrewdly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
After all, perhaps—— “I guess I made a mistake,”
she said at last, slowly. “It’s hard to guess sometimes.
I’ll take dinner with you and hear what you’ve
got to say. But you take my tip and don’t try any
funny business, or I’ll call a cop. See?”</p>

<p>The Professor nodded.</p>

<p>“All right, then,” declared the girl. “There’s a
spaghetti emporium right back of here on Sixth
Avenue. We’ll go there.”</p>

<p>A few moments later the trio were sitting in a huge
plate-glass restaurant, and Miss Lee, at the Professor’s
request, was ordering a somewhat elaborate
dinner. Then, while she awaited its coming, she
leaned forward across the table. “Well!” she began,
ignoring Bristow, who plainly desired to remain in
the background. “Well, now’s the time to spring
the story of your life in thirteen chapters and tell
what led up to this thrilling moment—unless you’d
rather wait till after the tooth-picks. You ain’t going
to spring an Arabian Nights fable on me, are you?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I may.”</p>

<p>“Really! Well, all right. I’m willing. Go
ahead.”</p>

<p>The waiter brought the soup, and the girl began
to eat with elaborate interest. The Professor noted
that her table manners were good and would arouse
no suspicion. Her slangy way of speaking gave
him some misgivings, but he put them aside.</p>

<p>“My name,” he began, “is Shishkin.”</p>

<p>“What!” The girl laid down her spoon and regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
him severely. “Well, you’re original, any
way,” she laughed. “Sure it ain’t Jones?”</p>

<p>“No—Shishkin. I am a Russian, but I have
been living in this country for twenty years. Will
you tell me something about yourself?”</p>

<p>“Cert. Florence Lee. Twenty years old. From
Missouri. Been working in New York three years.
Live in Brooklyn. Anything else? Want to see my
vaccination certificate?”</p>

<p>“No, what you have said is sufficient for the
present. I only wanted something to go on. I am a
scientist. My work is chiefly in connection with the
ocean. I am about to start for Europe on what will
undoubtedly be my last trip. Ordinarily, my
daughter would go with me, but she desires to get
married. I must have some one in her place.”</p>

<p>Miss Lee paused in the act of raising an olive to
her lips. “I ain’t a trained nurse,” she objected
tentatively.</p>

<p>“I don’t want a trained nurse,” returned the
Professor, with a show of spirit. “I have sought
you out because you look very much like my daughter.
What I want you to do is to take her place and
her name; to pretend to be she; and to go to Europe
with me. We may be gone six months. You shall
have everything my daughter would have had and
be treated exactly as she would be treated. Will
you go?”</p>

<p>But Miss Lee was past speech. With mouth
agape, she stared at the old man. Anything can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
happen in New York, but this went beyond her
experience.</p>

<p>“Well, if that ain’t the limit!” she murmured, at
last. “Say, when did you come out of Bellevue?”</p>

<p>“Bellevue?”</p>

<p>“The psychopathic ward. Gee! it must be a
lovely world you live in—till the pipe goes out.”</p>

<p>Dimly the Professor understood that he was being
mocked. “I am not jesting, young lady,” he explained,
with dignity. “I may add that when the
trip is over I will bring you back to New York and
give you a thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes burned into his. “I am not
for sale,” she answered briefly. “Don’t think it,
grandpop. There are plenty that are. Go after
them.”</p>

<p>“No one will do so well as you. Didn’t I explain?
I am compelled to seem to take my daughter with
me on this trip. I don’t want to take her, and she
does not want to go. Yet she must go unless I can
find some one to pass for her. You look like her.
When you dress as she does, you will look very much
like her. That is why I have come to you first.
With a few days’ training, you will find it easy to
pass for Olga, my daughter. No one who is going
on this trip has ever met her. And it won’t be
unpleasant. You will be treated with all honor and
consideration. Will you come?”</p>

<p>“Come!” Miss Lee had gone back to her
dinner and was discussing it with much gusto.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
“Look here, grandpop! Do you mean to tell me
that all this is on the level?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.” The Professor did not speak slang,
but he understood it to some extent.</p>

<p>Florence stared at him once more. She did not
believe that he was speaking the truth, or, rather—for
she had been trained in a hard school—she did
not believe that he was speaking the whole truth.
She felt sure that there was something behind—as,
indeed, there was. Still, she was tempted. A yacht,
a trip to Europe, a masquerade, and a thousand
dollars! It all sounded very fascinating to a girl
who realized that she might be thrown out of work
at any moment, with only a week’s salary between
her and starvation. Of course it might be a trap.
Florence was handsome, and she knew it; and she
had heard of traps for handsome girls. This might
be one, but if so, it was very elaborately baited.
Besides, she felt supreme confidence in her ability
to defend herself if need be. Still, she hesitated.</p>

<p>“How’m I to know?” she questioned. “The
men are always springing something new, and a
girl’s got to be mighty careful. I ain’t for sale;
anyhow, I ain’t on the bargain table; before I
go off I’ve got to be sure that the man’s on the
level and can do more than make a noise like a
tin bank. If you ain’t stringing me—if you ain’t
escaped from the crazy house—prove it. It oughtn’t
to be hard.”</p>

<p>Professor Shishkin considered. “My friend and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
future son-in-law, Mr. Bristow, will endorse everything
I say,” he declared. “Further, I should be
glad to have you talk with my daughter, whose
place you will take. Do you know East Orange?”</p>

<p>“New Jersey? Sure!”</p>

<p>“Very well. Come down there early to-morrow.
Ask any one to show you where Professor Shishkin
lives. You’ll find a pretty, vine-clad cottage. Nothing
at all to make you afraid. Come in and you’ll
find Olga and me waiting for you. I think we can
make you believe. Only”—the Professor’s voice
grew serious—“only please wear a veil, and don’t tell
any one what I have told you. I’d much rather you
would refuse outright than have you talk. I want
you to pass as my daughter. The moment the
truth gets out, you cease to be of use to me, and I
get into grave danger. So you must be secret. Now,
on that understanding, will you come?”</p>

<p>Miss Lee reached her hand across the table. “I’ll
come,” she promised. “I’ll see the thing through.
If it ain’t straight, you’re the biggest—— Well,
never mind, I’ll see it through.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“PUT not your faith in princes.”</p>

<p>Baron Demidroff, chief of the third section
of the Russian police, the dreaded secret
police, pondered this sentiment as he sat in the office
of his immediate superior, the Minister of the
Interior. The Baron had been thirty years in the
police service, and for fifteen years he had been its
chief. In those years he had weathered many a
storm that had bade fair to sweep him from place
and power, but never a one of them had seemed so
menacing as that which he was confronting.</p>

<p>“‘Had I but served my God with half the zeal I
served my king,’” he quoted, “‘he would not leave
me naked to my enemies.’ You think the case is
desperate, then?”</p>

<p>The Minister flung out his hands. “Judge for
yourself, Baron,” he said. “Count Strogoff demanded
your immediate dismissal. He was striking
at me over your shoulders, of course. Your retirement
meant mine, for I cannot afford to have one
of Strogoff’s men in your place. The Emperor knew
it, and that is the only reason you still hold your
post. I did what I could, and will do what I can.
But the most I could win was three months’ delay,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
and to get that I had to talk vaguely of great discoveries
you had in train. You will have to make them,
my friend, or it is good-by to power for both of us.”</p>

<p>The Baron considered. He was a vigorous young-old
man, with a hawk-like face, crowned by beautiful
white hair. His mustache and imperial were the
pink of military exquisiteness. In his eyes slumbered
a consuming fire.</p>

<p>“Humph!” he said slowly. “What discoveries
would your excellency suggest?”</p>

<p>The other laughed shortly, but with no merriment
in his tones. “First and best,” he answered, “find
the <i>Orkney</i> and recover her gold. Its loss is Strogoff’s
strongest card against you and me. I wish I had
never recommended borrowing that money on the
Princess Napraxine’s estates. To take it out of
Strogoff’s control was like snatching a bone from a
hungry dog.”</p>

<p>“Russia needed it,” hazarded the other.</p>

<p>“Of course Russia needed it. There was neither
justice nor expediency in longer holding an estate
for the benefit of a girl who had been missing
twenty years, and who is certainly dead. The
Emperor only anticipated when he decided to
escheat part of it. But Strogoff had controlled it as
trustee for ten years. It was madness to suppose that
he would not seek revenge when forced to give it up.”</p>

<p>“You counted on his enmity when you recommended
the escheatal.”</p>

<p>“Of course”—impatiently. “But I did not count<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
on the money being lost. That was your fault,
Baron. You were much to blame.”</p>

<p>The Baron’s face showed that he did not agree
with his superior’s assertion, but he offered nothing
in rebuttal. The Minister knew all the circumstances,
and if he chose to blame his subordinate,
that subordinate could gain nothing by demonstrating
the unjustness of the accusation.</p>

<p>“If I recover the gold even at this late day, how
then?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“It would help! It would help! It would gain
us time, and time fights for us. Find the gold, and
we can baffle Strogoff for a year or two longer; but
as long as he controls the vast remaining estates of
the Princess Napraxine, he will be dangerous.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Baron Demidroff tugged at his mustache
thoughtfully. “Failing recovery of gold,” he suggested,
“is there anything else your excellency can
recommend as likely to rehabilitate my position?”</p>

<p>“Nothing! Except, of course, the impossible.
Find the Princess Napraxine, and let her take the
control of her property out of Strogoff’s hands, and
he will be crippled permanently. But that is moonshine.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not!” The Baron smiled cheerfully
at the Minister. “Stranger things have happened.
As a matter of fact, I came here to-day to inform
your excellency that I have good hopes of recovering
the <i>Orkney’s</i> gold, and that I believe I have found
the Princess Napraxine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>The Minister did not start. Instead he sat and
stared at the Baron as if he would read the other’s
very soul. “Humph!” he grunted. “Humph!
Humph! Humph!” Then after a moment: “The
proofs will have to be very strong, Baron!”</p>

<p>“They will be indisputable.”</p>

<p>The other mused a moment. “The girl will
have to be carefully coached,” he suggested, “and
she will have to be a strong character to carry the
thing through. Strogoff is a hard man to deceive.
And detection would be serious!”</p>

<p>The Baron did not resent the clear imputation
that the other’s words conveyed. He seemed to take
distrust as a matter of course. “Your excellency is
mistaken,” he replied suavely. “This is no case of
imposition. I have really found the Princess.”</p>

<p>“After twenty years?”</p>

<p>“After twenty years! The proofs are not completed,
but the evidence is already morally conclusive.
If I can recover the gold, as I believe I can, I
should be ready even now to submit them to the
Emperor, confident that he would consider them
satisfactory.”</p>

<p>The Minister settled back in his chair with a long
breath. The thing was too good, and came too pat
to the moment, to be true. It seemed incredible
that the Princess Napraxine, stolen at the age of
three, should be found twenty years later and restored
to her rightful position. Still, Demidroff was a
wonderful man, and could be relied on not to undertake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
anything unless he had good prospects of
carrying it through. If he brought forward a claimant,
that claimant would be well fortified with proofs.
And if she won the estates, the victory would be so
overwhelming that it was worth taking some risks
to win it.</p>

<p>“Tell me as much of the story as you think best,
Baron,” he ordered.</p>

<p>The Baron obeyed. “As your excellency knows,”
he began, “I have agents in terrorist circles—practically
as many as they have in ours. Most things
that they do reach me in the course of time, though
usually too late to be of much value. Some months
ago I began to realize Strogoff’s power, and it seemed
to me that it might be well to find the Princess. It
occurred to me to make investigations through one
of my agents into the records of the Brotherhood
dating back to the time of the abduction. In consequence
I learned that the Princess had been stolen
by Count Lladislas, a Pole, who had been committed
to the fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul three years
before, at the behest of the Grand Duke Ivan, who
admired the Countess Lladislas. After Lladislas
was reported dead, the Countess married the Grand
Duke morganatically.</p>

<p>“Lladislas escaped and stole the child. Possibly
he had been misinformed and thought he was stealing
his own child; I am not certain as to this. At all
events, he passed her off as such. He took her to
America, changed his name to Shishkin, and became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
professor in one of the small colleges. He still lives,
and I think can be made to testify. I learned this
only yesterday, and am still considering how to go
about the matter.</p>

<p>“So much for the Princess. Now for the gold.
I learned recently, through the same agent who gave
me the first information in the matter of the Princess,
that the Brotherhood had obtained a clue to the
<i>Orkney’s</i> gold. My information was fragmentary,
but I learned that it had dispatched an agent to
New York to see a Mr. Ashton Caruth, to whom
had been sent a letter which was supposed to tell
something about the gold. I cabled Struve, our
consul-general at New York, to get that letter at all
hazards. He tried, but he bungled somewhere.
His men killed a valet of Caruth’s, but did not get
the letter. He does not know who did, but he believes
it is now in the hands of a woman calling herself
Marie Fitzhugh, who was in Caruth’s apartments
that night, and who is probably the agent of the
Brotherhood. She has not been identified yet, but
she will be soon. Struve is keeping a close watch
on her, and thinks that sooner or later she will lead
us to the gold.</p>

<p>“So the case stands. I am awaiting developments.
Any day—any hour—news may come. Did I speak
too strongly when I said I had hopes?”</p>

<p>The Minister sprang to his feet and thrust out his
hand enthusiastically. Naturally optimistic, he
was already certain of triumph. “Hopes!” he cried.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
“Hopes! They are more than hopes, my dear
Baron; they spell triumph.”</p>

<p>“I think so.” The Baron rose. “I have three
months’ time,” he added. “Much may be done in
three months.”</p>

<p>“Much indeed! Keep me advised.”</p>

<p>The Baron went out, but in ten minutes he was
back with a paper in his hand.</p>

<p>“I found this on my desk,” he cried. “It came
in half an hour ago. Read it.”</p>

<p>The message ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">New York.</span>—Shishkin announces departure to dredge in
Baltic for scientific purposes. Goes on yacht of Ashton Caruth.
Takes daughter with him.</p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE <i>Sea Spume</i>, with its curiously assorted passengers,
sailed from New York on Saturday.</p>

<p>Besides Caruth, it carried Marie Fitzhugh,
Professor Shishkin, his pretended daughter, Thomas
Wilkins, and several bewhiskered individuals whose
names ended in <i>ski</i> or <i>vitch</i>. They were the divers
whom Miss Fitzhugh had selected and Professor
Shishkin had brought along ostensibly to explore
the bottom of the Baltic for proofs of his theory of
rising sea-floors. Caruth felt sure that they were
nihilists and suspected them of having bombs on
their persons, but it was too late to balk at that.</p>

<p>The yacht was swift and the weather fine, and the
miles fell behind with gratifying regularity. The
sun shone bright by day, and the moon cast silvery
gleams by night. In short, the astronomy of the
trip was all that could be desired.</p>

<p>As soon as the yacht was out of sight of land, the
Professor, who was a born sailor, took occasion to
explain matters a little more fully to Miss Lee, who
likewise seemed not to feel the motion of the vessel.
He explained them not because he wanted to do so,
but because he could not help himself. The girl
was altogether too clever not to suspect that something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
was being kept back. In any event, she must
very soon find out that the yacht was going to dredge
for something besides sea creatures. Unless told
enough to satisfy her, she would surely ask questions
that might show her ignorance of matters concerning
which Olga could scarcely be supposed to be ignorant.
It was better to tell her something of the objects
of the trip rather than to risk the possible effects of
her inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>He told her that the <i>Sea Spume</i> was going to
search for a vessel that had been wrecked a year or
two before, with a large sum in gold on her. He
admitted frankly that he himself had come in order
that by his scientific reputation he might conceal
the true object of the trip.</p>

<p>He meant to go so far and no farther. But he had
not reckoned on Miss Lee. She heard him out;
then she turned questioner.</p>

<p>“These heart-to-heart talks are all right,” she
remarked, “if they are all right. But if they ain’t,
they’re punk. I’m from Missouri, y’know, and I’ve
got to be shown. Why d’ye want to hide the object
of your trip? Who owns this gold you’re after?”</p>

<p>The Professor hesitated. “My friends own it,” he
answered at last.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t they go after it openly? A
man’s got a right to his own, ain’t he? What’s the
need of all this masquerading?”</p>

<p>The Professor squirmed. The question, though
natural, was not what he had expected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Pitilessly the girl went on: “Who are you afraid
of? Who’s likely to interfere with you?”</p>

<p>“Well!” Professor Shishkin was desperate.
“Well!” he admitted. “I might as well tell you that
our title to the gold is disputed, and we are likely
to have trouble if it is known that we are after it.
It is really ours, but our enemies are unscrupulous
and dangerous, and they could make things very unpleasant
for us. They would have gotten the gold
long ago if they had known just where it was.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Then you do know just where it is?”</p>

<p>“We think we do.”</p>

<p>Miss Lee considered a while. “It ain’t good
enough,” she remarked. “I’ve studied geography,
and I’ve been looking up the Baltic lately. There’s
too much Russovitsky about this game. I’ll bet a
box of taffy there’s a nihilist plot mixed in it somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Sh!” The Professor’s face had changed, and
he held up his hand warningly. “There’ll be suspicion
enough on that point before long, I fear,”
he whispered. “Don’t start it any sooner than it
can be helped.”</p>

<p>“But is it true?”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you. You must draw your own conclusions.
If it is true, would you draw back? The
cause of the revolution is the cause of freedom.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Maybe so. I’ll think about it. But—I
want to know. What’ll the Czarski do to us if he
catches us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>“Nothing. We’ll lose the gold, but nothing more.
We are American citizens on an American vessel
on the high seas. No one will dare to touch us.”</p>

<p>“Well, where do I come in? What’s my part in
the melodrama?”</p>

<p>“You?” The Professor was amazed. “Why,
my dear young lady, my daughter wanted to marry
and didn’t want to come. I told you all this.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es. You told me why she didn’t want to
come. But you ain’t told me why you want everybody
to think she did come.”</p>

<p>The Professor hesitated, and the girl put her
finger on the weak spot. “You didn’t bring her
because you thought it was too dangerous,” she
remarked shrewdly; “and you didn’t want others
to know how risky you thought it was. And you
picked me for the goat. Ain’t that it?”</p>

<p>The Professor leaned forward. “Not exactly,”
he explained. “It <i>would</i> be very dangerous for her
to visit Russia. Being what she is and who she is,
it would be <i>very</i> dangerous. For you, it is not so.
Danger may threaten you, but you can always escape
by declaring who you are. With her it is different.
Besides”—he spoke slowly and impressively—“I
have reasons—reasons that I assure you are crucial—for
having it thought that she is with us. I implore
you to keep the secret. It might and probably would
cost her her life if certain persons on board suspected
the truth. You will keep faith?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure! I’ll keep faith. You needn’t worry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
about that. Especially if that stuck-up Fitzhugh
woman is one of the ‘certain persons.’”</p>

<p>The Professor said nothing more. He was by no
means satisfied with the situation; but, then, he had
been dissatisfied with it from the first. It was a mere
choice of evils, and, he told himself despondently,
in trying to better matters he was only too likely to
make them worse. Nothing but the absolute necessity
of keeping the real Olga out of Russia would
have ever driven him to such a desperate scheme as
this.</p>

<p>It was really more desperate than he knew,
though not more so than he might have guessed had
he known of the relations that were developing
between Miss Lee and Thomas Wilkins.</p>

<p>These two had drawn very close together during
the trip. While neither would have endured for a
moment any intimation that they were not as good
as any one breathing, still neither could help feeling
more or less out of place in their new surroundings.
The girl saw this more clearly and felt it more sharply
than the man. She recognized the fact that these
people were lucky enough to possess what she had
longed for all her life—money and social position—and
concluded that their ways must be correct ways.
Therefore she set herself to study them and to mould
herself by their standards. The conditions were
peculiar, and perhaps she might grasp the money
and the position if she once fitted herself for them.</p>

<p>Wilkins, on the other hand, had no yearnings for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
the social altitudes. It never occurred to him to
copy any one else’s manners. He only felt vaguely
uncomfortable, more or less seasick, and very much
bored. Therefore he welcomed the companionship
of the one person among the cabin passengers with
whom he somehow felt himself to be on a plane.</p>

<p>As the voyage continued, this intimacy increased.
Caruth noticed it and vaguely wondered at it; but
then he had wondered from the first at the rather
singular manners and conversation of the Professor’s
daughter. Miss Fitzhugh noticed it, and did not
like it; just why, she scarcely knew. But neither she
nor Caruth made any effort to check it. Supposing
Miss Lee to be the Professor’s daughter and therefore
devoted to his cause, they naturally were glad
of anything that tended to bind Wilkins closer to
their cause.</p>

<p>So matters ran along till nearly the end of the
voyage. Cattegat and Skagerrak had been traversed,
Copenhagen was a blur of light on the
clouds behind them; the widening sea space before
them showed that the broad Baltic lay close at
hand.</p>

<p>Miss Lee and Wilkins sat together on the quarter-deck
watching the moonlight as it shone white on
the wake of the <i>Sea Spume</i>. For some time neither
had spoken.</p>

<p>At last Wilkins broke the silence. “Lady,” he
said, “I s’pose your pa’s told you how I come to be
on this here trip?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>Florence nodded. The Professor had not told
her, but it seemed unnecessary to admit that fact.</p>

<p>Wilkins went on. “I’ll own right up to you,” he
explained, “that when I come I warn’t by no means
satisfied that I was gettin’ a square deal; a ten per
cent rake-off ain’t very high when you hold the
joker and nobody else can get nothin’ unless you
helps. Then I wasn’t satisfied about Jim. That
Miss Fitzhugh swears her friends didn’t kill him;
but, then, she naturally would, you know, and I’ve
got my doubts. Still, there didn’t seem nothin’ else
for me to do but to come along, and give ’em all the
rope they wanted, and watch my chance to find out
about Jim and to get a bigger share of the gold.
But I want to say now that that’s all to the past.
Your friends is my friends, and I’ll stick by ’em.
You understand?”</p>

<p>Florence did not understand—how should she?
She had never heard of “Jim,” nor of his death;
nor did she know that Wilkins held the key to the
location of the treasure. She was rapidly finding
out things, however; so she held her peace and let
the plainsman talk on.</p>

<p>“I promised to show them Bill’s letter as soon
as we got into the Baltic,” he continued. “That
means to-night. I guess I’d have done it any way,
but now I know you, I ain’t hesitatin’ no more.”</p>

<p>Florence found her tongue. “It’s Bill’s letter
that tells where the wreck is, isn’t it?” she guessed.</p>

<p>“Sure! The place ain’t much more than a day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
from here. I’m going to show it to them pretty soon.
But first I wanted to say somethin’ to you.”</p>

<p>Florence scarcely heard him. An idea, vague
and unformulated, was stirring in her brain. Could
any gain accrue to her personally from the fact that
Wilkins alone knew the whereabouts of the gold?</p>

<p>While she considered, the man went on. “Lady,”
he declared earnestly, “I’m a rough fellow, and I
know I ain’t half good enough for you. I know your
dad would have a fit if he thought I was makin’ love
to you; and your fine friends would think I was
crazy. Maybe I am; but it’s for you to say. I’m a
sheepman, lady, and many a night when I’ve been
bedded down alongside a camp-fire, watching them
muttons masticatin’ and baain’ to each other, I’ve
thought how nice it would be to go home to find
somebody waiting for me. And the minute I see
you and hear you talk so bright and clever, says I
to myself: ‘That’s the girl for me.’” Wilkins
paused for an instant and then went on. “I ain’t
no poor man, lady. I’ve got twenty-five thousand
baa-baas in Colorado. I didn’t come on this trip
for the money, though half a million ain’t to be snuz
at. So you’ll understand that when I gets my share
home I’ll be mighty well off. Now can’t you and
me frame it up together? Say the word, and I’ll
make ’em consent before I gives up the letter telling
where the gold is.”</p>

<p>Wilkins paused and waited for an answer. His
face was as expressionless as ever, but in spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
himself a tremor crept into his voice. Plainly he
was very much in earnest.</p>

<p>Florence, on the other hand, was by no means
ready to answer. To keep “him” guessing was one
of the cardinal precepts of the school in which she
had been trained.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered slowly; “not yet.”</p>

<p>A flush came on the Westerner’s face. “You
mean——” he began.</p>

<p>“I mean this ain’t bargain day,” exclaimed the
girl impatiently. “I ain’t saying a word against you,
but I’ll have to think a long time before I make up
my mind. When I do, it won’t be anybody on this
yacht that’ll stop me. But I guess I’ll have to leave
you on the anxious bench for a while.”</p>

<p>“All right, lady! Take your time.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to. But I’m goin’ to tell you something
right now, and that is that I ain’t stuck on this
crowd I’m with.”</p>

<p>Wilkins’s jaw dropped. “But your pa——”</p>

<p>“Popper ain’t the man he was. He ain’t nothing
but a deuce in this game. He ain’t going to make
anything out of it at all. Do you know who is?”</p>

<p>“Them revolutionists, I guess—what ain’t grafted
on the way.”</p>

<p>“Well! I’m not in this to help any old revolution.
I tell you right now, Mr. Wilkins, that it’s me for
the gold if I can get it to Noo York.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t you afraid of them bombovitches?”
demanded the man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Me! Not in Noo York, I ain’t. In Russia, I
ain’t saying.”</p>

<p>A delighted grin came over Wilkins’s face.
“Say!” he exclaimed. “You’re all rightski. They
tried to scare me with them fellows, and I let ’em
think they had, but, Lord sakes, they ain’t troubling
me none. If they come to Colorado after me, the
Czar’ll have one less to put in his dungeonoffski.”</p>

<p>“Then”—the girl held out her hand—“it’s
understood. We’ll stand together. If we get a
chance to skiddoo with the gold, we’ll do it. An’
I’ll marry you the day we get it to Noo York.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BLACK and high, the islands of the Aland
Archipelago rise out of the Baltic. All winter
long they lie bound about with ice. With the
spring, the ice, borne southward by the waking
streams of the north, grinds past them, scraping and
tearing, rending all that lies in its path. The short
summer follows, when the great bowl of the Baltic
rocks to the horizon like molten gold; when the black
rocks take on a coat of living green; and the sea
birds scream as they flash through the surf that
breaks against them or tears through the narrow
channels between.</p>

<p>On the eastern edge of the archipelago rise two
islands, Burndo and Ivono, Siamese twins whose tie
has not been wholly severed. The channel between
them lies almost east and west and not north and
south, and so has been spared the full scour of the
annual ice-flood. Cut deep at each seaward end, in
the middle it is interrupted by a dike of harder rock
that as yet persists against the inevitable and at
low tide changes it into two inlets that nearly touch
each other.</p>

<p>Into the western inlet, driven by her slowing
engines, and urged by waves and tide, the <i>Orkney</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
had sped two years before; had impaled herself
upon a sunken rock; and, shuddering backward,
had sunk with her crew and her passengers and her
million pounds sterling of gold.</p>

<p>No eye had seen her sink. The little fishing
village of Burndo, scattered along the western inlet,
close to the central neck, had slept soundly, lulled
by the roar of the wind. The watchman at the
beacon tower on the heights of Ivono Island had
dozed, not watching. If cries arose from the sinking
ship; if men battled for life in the surf; if the waves
hammered and the wind tore, it passed unnoticed.
When morning dawned the <i>Orkney</i> lay ten fathoms
deep, and the wreckage and bodies belonging to
her, caught in the tide, had been swept away toward
Copenhagen and the vast Atlantic. Two succeeding
winters had torn her masts away and ravished her
upper decks of all their superstructure. But the
hull lay intact, buried far beneath the green water.</p>

<p>For five days the <i>Sea Spume</i> had lain moored
close to the head of the channel, within sight of the
village, while the divers searched the bottom hour
after hour until the last ray of daylight vanished.
One of them was really a scientific assistant, and to
him was allotted the task of making such observations
and collecting such specimens as would naturally
have been desired by Professor Shishkin, had
the object of the expedition actually been that which
it purported to be. Indeed, so far as the Professor
was concerned, the work was conducted in good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
faith, the researches planned really being in exact
line with his long-cherished ambitions.</p>

<p>The other two divers, under direction of Captain
Wilson, commander of the <i>Sea Spume</i>, who had
necessarily been taken into confidence some time
before, lost no time in setting about their search
for the wreck. In less than half an hour after the
<i>Sea Spume</i> was in position, they were hard at work
at the bottom of the inlet.</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that the search would
be brief. The inlet (or high-tide channel), though
comparatively small, was large as compared with
the <i>Orkney</i>. Its bottom was rocky, with irregular
humps and unexpected holes, making search slow
and difficult. Even if the unlucky steamer had run
upon the beach itself, it must have slipped back and
been carried by the current to a greater or less
distance—just how far no one could predict. The
divers might chance on it at their first descent, or
might not discover it for a week or more. And after
it was found would come the toilsome task of salvaging
the gold. Five million dollars would weigh about
ten tons, and, even lightened as it would be by being
in the water, it would not be the work of a day to
move it, even if it could be readily come at, which
was improbable.</p>

<p>The adventurers had laid their plans with a full
knowledge of these facts. Had there been any chance
of speedy work, they might have tried to conceal
their presence, but under the circumstances this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
would be impossible. Therefore they had resolved
to proclaim their presence and even to welcome
visitors if any should appear, up to the moment
before the gold began to be brought aboard.</p>

<p>Besides the advisability of making their presence
known to the authorities, there was always the off-chance
that careful watch as the launch sped to and
fro in the inlet might disclose the <i>Orkney</i> lying like
a dark shadow beneath the water. The fisher boats,
of course, had not discovered it, but this argued
little, because the boats generally used the other,
or eastern, outlet, rather than the western; and
further, perhaps, because the fishermen were not
looking for anything of the kind.</p>

<p>So soon as possible after the divers had gone below
the water, Caruth ordered out a steam launch to
make the quarter-mile trip to the head of the inlet
and visit the village which he knew lay there, though
screened from view of the yacht by a turn in the
channel.</p>

<p>Caruth had intended to go to the village alone on
the first trip, leaving Marie Fitzhugh (who thought
it best not to show herself) and Captain Wilson to
superintend affairs on board the yacht and deal
with any emergencies that might arise. It was no
part of his plan to take Wilkins along, but when that
individual joined him, evidently intending to go, he
did not quite know how to refuse.</p>

<p>So far, he had no reason to question the plainsman’s
good faith. Wilkins had produced his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
brother’s letter at the time promised, and it had
proved to be all that he had claimed for it. Caruth
could not risk exciting any animosity by showing
unwillingness to trust the man on shore.</p>

<p>Suddenly, in the midst of his hesitation, he recalled
the westerner’s marked liking for the pretended
Olga Shishkin, and at once sought out that young
woman and invited her to go on the trip to the
village.</p>

<p>“You’ll be doing us all a favor if you’ll come,
Miss Shishkin,” he urged. “Of course we are all
loyal and all that, but”—he dropped his voice—“none
of us know very much about Wilkins, and it
would make things a good deal safer for your father
and the rest of us if you’d go along and keep an eye
on him. He’s all right, you know, but——”</p>

<p>“But you’re on the anxious bench all the same.
I know how it is myself. Sure! I’ll go with pleasure,
Mr. Caruth.”</p>

<p>The run up to the village was brief, and soon the
launch grated against a little wooden pier and disembarked
her passengers, who started toward the
cluster of buildings that seemed to constitute the
village.</p>

<p>“There’s the church and the store and the post-office
and the mayor’s house,” explained Caruth,
pointing out the several edifices. “There’s no mistaking
any of them, once you know the type. I’ll
have to go to the mayor first, to report my arrival,
and give him a chance to inform St. Petersburg.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
You needn’t come in unless you like. It will take
only a few minutes, and then we can see the town.”</p>

<p>By the time the party had reached the village,
quite a little crowd had collected. Visitors are few
on Burndo Island, and the news of their coming
spread apace. Curious faces appeared at doors
and windows, and gaping children lined the way.</p>

<p>Caruth vanished into the house of the mayor,
where he found that his business would take a much
longer time than he had expected. The mayor, a
stupid and suspicious peasant, spoke no English,
and Caruth spoke no Russian, and there was a delay
until an interpreter could be found.</p>

<p>This interpreter proved to be a slim fellow,
whose appearance, despite the fact that his features
were hidden by a profusion of beard, nevertheless
impressed Caruth with a vague sense of familiarity.
For an instant, indeed, the young fellow was sure
that he had seen the man before; the next moment,
however, he dismissed the idea as preposterous.</p>

<p>But he quickly adverted to his former feeling when
the interpreter addressed him in very good American.</p>

<p>“Mornin’, Cap’n,” he said, with a nod. “This
old son of a gun wants to know who you are and
what you want here, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Caruth gave his name and explained the object
of his trip; then added: “Who are you? You talk
like an American.”</p>

<p>“American! Well, I guess yes! Me for the starry
banner every time. I’m from little old Noo York;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
I am. But wait a minute till I tell his pie-face what
you say.”</p>

<p>He turned and translated what Caruth had said
into halting Russian, and then appeared to render
into English something that the Mayor said in return.</p>

<p>“He says you are a liar or crazy,” he translated
cheerfully. “He puts it kinder easier, but that’s
what it means all right. Say, that yarn you told me
about hunting things at the bottom of the bay is
straight, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Of course it’s straight.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll try to sneeze it to him again, though
I ain’t much on the Russian. It tastes too much
like it sounds, and that’s enough. Say! I suppose
you belong to the safety vault crowd and have barrels
of simoleons at home!”</p>

<p>Caruth flushed; then laughed. The man’s impudence
was refreshing. “Well,” he admitted,
“I’ve got enough to keep me going.”</p>

<p>“I guessed so. Wait a minute. I must keep the
old geezer satisfied.” He turned and for a moment
the language of the Czar held the floor. Finally
the man resumed.</p>

<p>“It’s that touch of yours about rising sea bottoms
that gets him,” he explained. “He says he’s lived
here all his life and never saw the sea-bottom rise
yet, ’cept when the tide goes out. It’s a tough sort
of a gag to spring on one of these two-by-four
government officers what rank somewhere between
jack high and a bobtail flush and is intelligenced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
according. Not but what I reckon it’s true enough.
But about this here question of wealth. If you’ve
got it to burn, I don’t reckon you’d care to pyramid
it a million or so, would you?”</p>

<p>Caruth was startled, his unquiet conscience making
him suspect that everything any one said to him
had reference to his true errand.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he answered cautiously. “What
have you got? A gold mine?”</p>

<p>The man laughed shortly. “A gold mine!” he
echoed. “A gold mine! Well, I guess you might
call it that. What I want to know is, do you care
to go in on it? Or if you don’t, will you help out an
American marooned on this durned holeski?”</p>

<p>Caruth nodded uneasily. “Oh, I suppose so,”
he answered slowly. “I’m always willing to help
a fellow countryman. But you’ll have to explain.”
The man nodded. “I’ll explain all right,” he
promised. “But you’ve got to answer all the questions
on this sheet of paper first or you’ll have the
Czarski in your hairski.”</p>

<p>The questions were long and tedious, and when
they were finished Caruth rose with a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>The interpreter rose also. “I’ve told his joblots
that you want me to show you round the mud
puddle,” he explained. “That’ll give me a chance to
spiel. Come along.”</p>

<p>The two walked to the door. As they walked out,
Wilkins met them. “Miss Shishkin’s looking at
the church,” he explained. “She’s——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>He broke off and his face grew red, then white,
as his eyes fell on the interpreter. Once or twice he
swallowed; then coughed. “D—— that Russian
tobacco!” he exclaimed. “It’s been strangling me
ever since I sniffed it half an hour ago.”</p>

<p>Caruth, who had waited smilingly till the plainsman
recovered, glanced toward the church. “Shall
we go over and join Miss Shishkin?” he suggested.
“I’ve got an interpreter here who can—— Hello!
what’s become of the fellow?”</p>

<p>The interpreter had vanished. In the few instants
that Caruth’s attention was centred on Wilkins, he
had slipped away, probably around one of the houses
that stood close by. At first Caruth supposed that
the disappearance would be but temporary, but as
the minutes went by without sign, he was forced to
conclude that it was both permanent and intentional.</p>

<p>When at last doubt no longer remained, the young
fellow laughed angrily. “Let him go, confound
him!” he exclaimed. “He was half crazy, anyhow.
Come! Let’s go to the church.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" >CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NEITHER Wilkins nor Florence had waited
long for Caruth to return. In fact, that
gentleman had scarcely vanished into the
mayor’s office when Florence had turned to her
companion.</p>

<p>“Gee!” she remarked. “Me for the breakaway.
These high-brows gets on me nerves. Let’s see the
town—even if it ain’t all to the giddy, it’s better
than the old boat. Gee! but it’s slow!” Miss Lee,
it will be observed, was glad to pretermit, when
opportunity offered, the forms of polite speech that
she was rapidly acquiring.</p>

<p>Wilkins looked at her suspiciously. “You ain’t
seemed in no ways bored,” he suggested.</p>

<p>“Oh, I got to put up a front, of course,” rejoined
the girl indifferently; “but if it wasn’t for you, I
guess I’d fade away. This style of life’s all right
for those that likes it, I guess, but it’s me for Coney
Island every time.”</p>

<p>They had reached the church now and were peering
in at the open door. Miss Lee was not impressed;
she had seen Russian churches in her beloved New
York, and mentally compared them with this one,
much to its disadvantage. Wilkins, however, found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
it all new and interesting. The candles ranged before
the icons, the gilt and glass of the altar, the tawdry
trappings, all impressed him, and he advanced into
the building, studying its details.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_138">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_138.jpg" alt="PARDON, MADEMOISELLE! I MUST SPEAK TO YOU SECRETLY">

<p class="caption">“PARDON, MADEMOISELLE! I MUST SPEAK TO YOU SECRETLY”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Scarcely had he left the girl when a man dressed
in the habiliments of a priest stepped to her side,
holding out his hat, as if for alms. As Florence
stared at him, he muttered swiftly, in excellent
English:</p>

<p>“Pardon, mademoiselle! I must speak to you
secretly. You have been deceived. You are not
Professor Shishkin’s daughter. You are a princess
of Russia with a huge fortune. I have come from
St. Petersburg to talk with you. Give me a chance,
I beg.”</p>

<p>Miss Lee turned away. “Say, Mr. Wilkins,” she
called. “I left my jacket in the boat. Would you
mind chasin’ down and gettin’ it for me? I’ll wait
here for you.”</p>

<p>When the plainsman had gone, Florence turned to
the priest. “Make good,” she ordered briefly.
“You look like the Caliph of Bagdad, and I guess
you can do the magic. If I’m a face-card instead of
a two-spot, of course I want to know it.”</p>

<p>The priest did not answer Florence’s speech in
words. Turning, he stepped to the door and threw
out his hand. “Begone!” he shouted to the curious
crowd, and at the word it melted away.</p>

<p>Then he came back. “Will you not be seated,
Princess?” he inquired courteously, pointing toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
a bench that stood against the wall. “I regret that
I have no better accommodation to offer you,
but——”</p>

<p>Florence took the seat. “Cut it out,” she advised.
“Get on with the fairy tale.”</p>

<p>The priest removed his cap and threw back his
vestments, revealing himself as a well-preserved,
courtly gentleman of perhaps fifty years of age.
Beautiful white hair curled about his brow, while
his beard and mustaches were the pink of military
perfection. Florence, studying him furtively, found
him very good to look upon. To her he represented
romance, aristocracy, refinement—all that she had
never had in her sordid life. He was too old to
play Prince Charming, she concluded, but he was
of the type to which she believed Prince Charming
belonged.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the priest was seating himself. “No
fairy tale. Princess,” he contradicted deferentially—“unless
we liken it to Cinderella and transform the
beautiful, wronged young lady into the princess.
Rather let us call it a masquerade. I am not what
I seem. You are not what you seem. Your whole
expedition is not what it seems. We are all masked.
But the time for unmasking is at hand.”</p>

<p>Florence stared at him languidly. “I suppose
you know what you mean,” she remarked insolently.
“But I don’t.”</p>

<p>“How should you until I explain? First, Princess,
I am not a priest.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“I knew it. What are you? A wizard?”</p>

<p>“I am Baron Ivan Demidroff, chief of the third
section of the Russian police. Perhaps you know
what that means. Your yacht has been watched
ever since it entered the Baltic, and I am here for
the express purpose of meeting you. If I may advise,
Princess, it is not well to scoff always. This affair
is not one for laughter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, splash! Excuse these tears of regret!”
mocked the girl. “Go ahead! I’ll be good.”</p>

<p>For a moment the Baron studied the girl’s face.
Then he shrugged his shoulders. Privately he was
revising his former opinions about American training
and manners. He had not met Florence’s type
before.</p>

<p>“You have always supposed yourself the daughter
of Professor Shishkin, have you not, Princess?” he
questioned.</p>

<p>Florence dodged. “Well, I got a right to,” she
answered. “He told me so himself.”</p>

<p>“I know. He did you a grave injustice. Listen,
Princess! Twenty years ago, the man you suppose
to be your father engaged in a plot to murder my
imperial master the Czar. The plot was detected,
and its authors were thrown into prison. Three years
after, Shishkin escaped. In some way he had gotten
the idea that his highness, the Grand Duke Ivan, had
been responsible for his arrest. It was not true, but
he believed it. So he slipped into the palace of the
Grand Duke and stole away his daughter, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
Princess Yves Napraxine. He escaped with her to
America and passed her off as his daughter. You
were that child! You were and are that princess,
Yves Napraxine, daughter of the late Grand Duke
Ivan, cousin to his imperial majesty the Czar, and
heiress to a great fortune. All this would have been
yours from birth up had not that wicked old man
stolen you away and robbed you of it.”</p>

<p>Florence closed her eyes. She felt faint. Ever
since Professor Shishkin had approached her in
New York, she had been wondering to what the
adventure would lead. Naturally romantic, in spite
of her flippancy, she had thought out half a dozen
possible terminations, the least of which left her rich
and honored. But never in her wildest imaginings
had she dreamed of being identified as a princess
and a cousin of the Czar.</p>

<p>A delightful excitement raced through her veins.
In imagination she was already receiving homage
and declining the hands of great nobles. Then,
all at once, the “pipe went out.” None of this
could be hers. It all belonged to the real Olga,
married and settled three thousand miles away.
The truth must of course soon appear; all she could
do was to get all the pleasure possible out of the
situation while it lasted. Perhaps she might manage
to feather her nest by that time.</p>

<p>Her thoughts flew to the Professor. So this was
the reason why he had wanted to keep the real
Olga out of Russia? He had dreaded just such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
a disclosure as this. Well, she would help him
as long as she could—that is, as long as his interests
did not clash with hers. When they did,
of course——</p>

<p>The Baron had been watching her closely, trying
to read her changing face.</p>

<p>“Ah ha!” he exclaimed. “You understand now
perhaps some things you could not guess before.
Perhaps you remember details of your childhood,
almost forgotten. You were three years old when
you were stolen, and some recollection sticks in
your mind. Is it not so?”</p>

<p>“Yes, some recollection sticks in my mind.”
Florence wondered grimly what the Baron would
say if he knew what her recollections really were.</p>

<p>“The villain has robbed you of your birthright,”
he repeated, with what seemed to be rising wrath.
“But now it shall all be restored. Yes!”</p>

<p>Florence nodded, not trusting herself to speak.
The situation was too new and strange, and she
must move circumspectly. Besides, she was certain
the Baron had more to say. She had been taught
in a hard school, and was very sure that his actions
were not disinterested. So she merely waited.</p>

<p>Baron Demidroff did not delay. “Yes,” he reiterated.
“It shall all be restored, and the robber
shall be punished. But there is more to tell, Princess.
To whom, think you, belongs the gold for which
the <i>Sea Spume</i> is seeking?”</p>

<p>“What gold?” Florence looked innocently into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
the Baron’s eyes. She would admit nothing until
compelled to do so.</p>

<p>“What gold? <i>Mon Dieu</i>, Princess, do you think
we police are fools? Every step of the so-called Miss
Fitzhugh and of Monsieur Caruth has been known
to us. Almost we captured the letter on the fire-escape
in New York. But <i>Monsieur le valet</i> was too
cunning for us.”</p>

<p>Florence raised her eyes. “So,” she murmured
thoughtfully, “it was your agents who murdered
Wilkins?”</p>

<p>“Executed him, Princess. He was a robber and
a murderer, with a long criminal record. We knew
him well. His robbery of Monsieur Caruth was his
last crime. My men observed him from the fire-escape
and acted summarily. That is all.”</p>

<p>Florence did not understand half of this. She
had been told nothing of Wilkins’s murder, her only
knowledge being inferred from what his brother had
said to her about it three days before. She laid away
in her mind the information the Baron so freely
imparted, and waited.</p>

<p>“So you let the letter get by you,” she suggested.</p>

<p>The Baron flung up his hands. “Alas, yes,
Princess. But we watched and waited, and when
Miss Fitzhugh organized her little expedition, we
guessed that she had somehow gotten the letter.
But, <i>mademoiselle, revenons à nos moulons</i>! Do
you know whose gold it is they seek?”</p>

<p>Florence shook her head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>“It is yours! Yes, Princess, I swear it. Your
illustrious father had never given up the hope of
finding you, and when he died, ten years ago, his
will directed that his estate should be set aside for
you or be spent in seeking for you. When Russia’s
needs became great owing to the war with Japan,
my imperial master directed that money be borrowed
for the government on your English estates. If you
were found, he would pay it back; if you were not
found, the estate would in time revert to the Crown.
That gold was carried by the <i>Orkney</i>, wrecked by
the nihilists, and is now being stolen from you by
your pretended father and his rascally associates.
It makes one’s blood boil, Princess!”</p>

<p>For obvious reasons, Florence’s blood did not
boil quite so ardently as the Baron’s seemed to do.
Plainly he was trying to excite her animosity against
the members of her party, for reasons not yet disclosed,
but not difficult to guess in a general way.
She was sure that he was preparing to ask her to
play traitor, and she was debating inwardly whether
or not she would find it profitable to do so.</p>

<p>“It’s a real fervent tale,” she remarked encouragingly.
“Gee! wouldn’t it make a hit on the ten-twent’-thirt’
circuit. Think of the Czarski doing
the hands-across-the-sea act to an American girl!
By the way, I forgot how you said you found me!”</p>

<p>Baron Demidroff hesitated. “It is a long story,”
he boggled. “We got a hint from a friend of ours
in the nihilist councils, and we followed it up. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
proofs were completed only after your party sailed
from America. The last Unit came by cable a few
days ago.”</p>

<p>Florence rose. “Well,” she said, “if it satisfies
you, I certainly ain’t got any kick coming. But I
guess you’d better get down to brass tacks and be
done with it. Do I get this estate and princely rank,
or don’t I? Talk business! I’m no ingénue.”</p>

<p>The Baron’s eyes lighted up. At last he thought
he understood. He rose. “Ah!” he exclaimed.
“You will treat with us! That is well. You will
get everything if you help us! We want that gold.
The Emperor is responsible to you for it, and he
has charged us to recover it. Is it in the Inlet here?”</p>

<p>“You can search me!”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Oh, gee, I don’t know! Nobody knows! They’re
hunting for it here, but I don’t think they’re certain
it ain’t somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t the letter tell?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen any letter.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” The Baron was disappointed. “Well,
no matter!” he went on. “You can help me nevertheless.
Let me know when they find it, and I
will do the rest. The moment it is in my hands,
I will hand you the proofs that will make you a
princess and give you a fortune of forty million
rubles—twenty million American dollars. Will you
help us?”</p>

<p>Florence shivered with delight. If she were clever,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
she might coax some of those twenty millions to come
her way. But matters were still decidedly vague.</p>

<p>“Why can’t you seize the yacht now?” she asked.
“Why do you need my help?”</p>

<p>“My dear young lady!” the Baron exclaimed.
“We do not know where the wreck is! We do not
know that she is in this inlet at all. It may be for
a blind that the yacht comes here. If we seize her
before she finds the gold, we know nothing and we
get nothing. Mr. Caruth he draw himself up. ‘Ah
ha!’ he cries. ‘You insult the American flag!’ The
American newspapers raise the—the war-whoop—and
we—we can answer nothing. We have no proof.
But when the gold is once aboard, we get it and we
can catch Mr. Caruth red-handed. He is caught
stealing our gold. He can say nothing. If he makes
trouble, the American papers are dumb or they
take our side. Russia’s friendship with America is
not disturbed. It is only a pirate that is caught. Ah,
no, no, Princess. We must proceed slowly. We
must know our ground before we move. We must
wait until the gold is found. Now what say you?”</p>

<p>Florence considered. Clearly, nothing was to be
gained by refusing the Baron outright. She must
have time to decide on her course of action. If it
appeared best to betray the yacht, she would not
hesitate to do so; but she had no intention of playing
the traitor unless she saw her profit. She must study
over the situation. Meanwhile, she would appear
to accept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>“All right,” she said briefly. “I’ll go with you. I’ll
let you know when the gold is found. How’ll I do
it?”</p>

<p>If Baron Demidroff was gratified, he did not show
it. He was no longer treating Florence as a girl,
but as a woman and a fellow conspirator.</p>

<p>“Your stateroom is the second on the port side,
I believe,” he said tersely. “Very well. When the
gold is found, hang a small red flag from your port-hole
or show a red light there by night. It is understood?
Yes? But your friend approaches. <i>Adieu,
Madame la Princesse!</i>”</p>

<p>As he walked up the aisle toward the altar, Miss
Lee rose to greet Wilkins. “Gee!” she exclaimed.
“Let’s get back on board. This place is as dead as
a puddle duckski!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THREE days after Florence’s adventure at the
church, that young woman sat on the quarter-deck
of the <i>Sea Spume</i>, gazing with unseeing
eyes over the lapping water which the descending sun
had turned into a golden river stretching away to the
west. Upon this yellow flood two boats were moving,
and on these Miss Lee’s eyes were fixed.</p>

<p>But her thoughts were far away. Not once since
Baron Demidroff had told his amazing tale had its
substance been out of her ears. Again and again
she had gone over the details, wondering if by any
chance she could make the fairy tale come true.</p>

<p>In time she almost persuaded herself that she could.
She was sure that she understood at last why the
Professor had not wanted to bring his daughter to
Russia. He had been afraid of this very thing—afraid
lest Olga’s relatives should find her and reclaim
her. More than ever now, he would want to keep
the substitution secret. And no one else knew of it.</p>

<p>Florence’s heart leaped within her as the possibilities
danced before her mind’s eye. Let her only
dare to go ahead and she would have money and
wealth. Why not?</p>

<p>A princess! Sharply she drew her breath at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
thought. A princess! She! Florence Lee! She
who had faced beggary a few short weeks before!
Princess Yves Napraxine! Princess Yves Napraxine!
Again and again she wrote the words on the
flyleaf of a book that lay in her lap. Princess Yves
Napraxine! If it could be! If it could be!</p>

<p>A step on the deck aroused her. Hastily she closed
the book, with its tell-tale writing, and looked up to
see Wilkins close at hand.</p>

<p>Rapidly he strode to the rail and gazed toward the
boats; then he turned abruptly back and sat down
beside the girl.</p>

<p>“They’re getting mighty contiguous,” he declared.
“I reckon they’ll oscillate on it to-night. Well, it
don’t matter; everything’s ready.”</p>

<p>Curiously Miss Lee gazed at him. “What in the
world are you talking about?” she demanded.</p>

<p>Wilkins withdrew his eyes from the dancing water
and fixed them on the girl. For a moment he looked
her in the face; then he deliberately winked.</p>

<p>Miss Lee struck at him. “Don’t get fresh,” she
ordered severely. “I don’t allow gentlemen to wink
at me except over a cold bottle. Speak out and quit
making signs.”</p>

<p>Wilkins chuckled. “Say! You’re all to the good,”
he remarked. “I’m ready if you are.”</p>

<p>“Ready for what?”</p>

<p>“To foreclose on that there promissory note of
yourn—that one about the gold. I’m ready to start
for New York if you are. Fact is, I’m off to-night!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“To-night!”</p>

<p>“Sure thing! It’s me for the broad Atlantic by
the light of the moon this very night. Say, don’t
you want to shake this gang and come along?”</p>

<p>The girl paled slightly. “Tell me what you mean
right away,” she ordered crisply.</p>

<p>Wilkins pointed over the water. “You see that
right-hand boat pronouncin’ around yonder?” he
questioned. “Well, near’s my specification goes,
the <i>Orkney</i> lies just about under her. Unless they’re
too terrible promiscuous, they’ll find her mighty
soon, and then there’ll be goings on worse’n a locoed
bronco.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” The girl was leaning over
him, every muscle tense with excitement. “How do
you know where the <i>Orkney</i> is, and why will there be
trouble when it is found?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Because—say, I guess you didn’t see a slim,
limpy fellow with a black hirsute adornment on his
chin up in the village the day we was up there, did
you? Well, that fellow was Bill, my brother Bill,
the one that wrote the epizootle that brung us here.
He wasn’t drowned in the <i>Orkney</i>—Bill wasn’t born
to be drowned. Everybody else was, but he got on
terra cotta, and he’s been hibernating here ever since,
waiting his chance to get away with the gold.”</p>

<p>“The gold!”</p>

<p>“Yes! Bill’s got it. How he done it, I don’t
know. But he’s got it. Bill’s a man of his hands,
Bill is! He’s got all them nuggets out of the ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
and cached ’em ashore. There ain’t a speck of
dust left on the <i>Orkney</i>. Bill’s got it all!”</p>

<p>Amazement gripped Florence and held her dumb.
The gold whose capture was to be the price of proofs
of her princesshood had passed into other hands.
What was she to do? There was no time to lose.
Should she betray Wilkins to Caruth or to the Baron?
How could she betray him to the Baron even if she
wanted to? Should she grasp at the money and let
the visionary rank go. She did not question whether
she should be true to Professor Shishkin. Long
before, she had decided that question.</p>

<p>Abruptly she spoke. “Well, what are you going
to do?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“Going to run the gold off, of course,” returned the
plainsman. “Bill’s got a boat of sorts—a schooner
or pergola or something—and he’s got the gold on
board by now. I’ve staked him to buy provisions,
and we’re off to-night. Bill would have gone before,
but he’s been crippled up since the wreck, and
couldn’t manage the boat alone. But it’s all skeeky
now. The scow’s lying up here a ways, just a-waiting
for dark and for you and me to join her. If it
coincides with your sentiments, we’ll do the fly away
act to-night. Will you come?”</p>

<p>Miss Lee considered. Of course it would be
delightful to be a princess, but, after all, there might
be a string tied to Demidroff’s offer, while there was
something substantial about five million dollars in
gold. It might be well to pass up the fairy tale and
close with Wilkins. She must consider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“You can’t cross the Atlantic in a sloop,” she
objected.</p>

<p>“Ain’t going to try. We’ll just run over the way
to Stockholm to a place Bill knows of, and go home
from there by steamer. Oh, we’ve got it all diagnosed
out proper. It’s a cinch.”</p>

<p>“But”—Florence was thinking aloud—“how are
you goin’ to get away from the yacht?”</p>

<p>“That’s fixed, too. Bill will float down under
the cabin windows about ten o’clock, just before the
moon gets on the job, and we’ll drop in on him.”</p>

<p>“But when they find we’re gone——”</p>

<p>“Let ’em find. What difference does it make?
They may aspirate to get this here gold, but that
don’t make it theirs. Bill and me’s got it, and I guess
we’ll keep it. Why, say, there ain’t one of ’em’ll
dare to baa even if they find us, which they won’t.
Oh, it’s a cinch.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps! And yet—say, Mr. Wilkins, you’ve
been on the level with me, and I’m going to treat
you likewise. Don’t you be too sure you’ve got a
cinch! There’s others besides the folks on this
yacht that’s after that gold.”</p>

<p>Wilkins did not speak, but he looked the girl in the
eye and waited for her to go on.</p>

<p>“The Russian cops are onto their jobs all right.
They know what we’re after, and they’re watching
us all the time. They’re ready to swoop down on
us the minute we get the gold on board. I guess
they’ve got a dozen boats lying around here.”</p>

<p>Wilkins looked thoughtful. “Humph!” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
“You’re all to the good, you are. You ain’t been
wasting no time, have you? How’d you find out?”</p>

<p>“The priest! That day at the church. He wanted
me to help him.”</p>

<p>“And you strung him along, all right, didn’t you?
You would, of course!” He paused, then went on.
“Well,” he remarked; “I don’t reckon it makes no
difference. They won’t be suspecting a fishing
schooner of any allusions, and they won’t be aggravatin’
us none. They’ll be keepin’ their optics
trained on the yacht circumspectious. We can slip
out easy. Is it a go?”</p>

<p>Florence held out her hand. “It’s a go,” she
agreed. “More! I’ll help you to get away. I’ll
fix things so that the yacht won’t have any time to
bother us. Yes, it’s a go. And now——”</p>

<p>Swiftly Florence opened the book that lay in her
lap and ripped out the flyleaf with its princely inscription.
Swiftly she tore it into tiny fragments
and tossed it to the breeze that sang through the
rigging. “There!” she cried, as the bits besprinkled
the water. “That’s the end of the Princess Yves
Napraxine. It’s a go.”</p>

<p>“The Princess which?”</p>

<p>“Somebody you never heard of. A bird in the
bush. A dream of the impossible. A romance from
the <i>Chambermaid’s Own</i>. Let her go. I’ll be ready
when you are.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT night the wreck was found. Seated in
the cabin, close beside the telephone that led
over the side down to the divers toiling beneath
the darkening water, Caruth received the
thrilling news.</p>

<p>Instantly hoarse orders rang through the ship,
and the crew sprang to their stations. The furnace
doors were flung open and brawny stokers hurled
coal upon the banked fires until the hiss of steam
told that the <i>Sea Spume</i> was ready to race for the
open sea the moment the gold was on board.</p>

<p>Below, the divers were picking their way over the
sunken hull, seeking the storage place of the treasure.</p>

<p>Above, at the telephones, stood Caruth and Marie
Fitzhugh, cheeks flushed and eyes a-sparkle.</p>

<p>“At last! At last!” breathed the girl; and “At
last! At last!” echoed Caruth.</p>

<p>His tones penetrated to the girl’s consciousness,
and she blushed brightly. In the triumph of her
cause, she had forgotten that Caruth’s object and
hers were not the same.</p>

<p>She blushed, but she did not draw away. After
all, if she were fated to give herself for Russia, to
sell herself to Caruth in return for his help in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
cause of freedom, the sacrifice would not be so very
hard. Indeed, it might not be hard at all. If policy
were to govern her mating, this clean-limbed, clean-thinking
young American would be a better mate
than many a one who had sought her in the past.
The Brotherhood must decide; she had sworn herself
body and soul to its orders; but she found herself
suddenly hoping that the Brotherhood might find
Caruth’s claims worthy.</p>

<p>Smilingly she looked into the young man’s eyes.
“Not yet,” she murmured. “Not yet. We are not
out of the woods yet, and until we are you must
remember your promise.”</p>

<p>“My promise?”</p>

<p>“To give all your thoughts to the business in hand.
Not to make love to me. Not to——”</p>

<p>“Great Cæsar’s Ghost! You don’t call this making
love, do you? With you half a mile away across
the cabin, and me with this telephone harness on
my head. Just you wait and——” Excitedly he
devoured her with his eyes.</p>

<p>Brightly she blushed, and restlessly she moved.
Then she pressed a button on the wall. “I am
going to send for Mr. Wilkins and Miss Shishkin
to come and hear the news with us,” she explained.
“We owe Mr. Wilkins an apology for distrusting
him.”</p>

<p>When the steward entered, she sent him to find
the two and ask them to come to the cabin.</p>

<p>When the man had gone, Caruth looked at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
and laughed. “Yes,” he agreed, “I guess I owe
Wilkins an apology, but I could make it later just
as well as now. I’m inclined to think that Miss
Shishkin has had more to do with his good faith
than anything else, anyhow. Queer girl, isn’t she,
to be the Professor’s daughter. Not the sort I should
have expected at all.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. However—— Well, Barnes, what is it?”</p>

<p>The steward had entered, hastily. “Mr. Wilkins
and Miss Shishkin don’t seem to be aboard, ma’am!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Not aboard? Nonsense! They must be!”</p>

<p>“I’ve hunted everywhere, ma’am. I’ve looked
in Miss Shishkin’s cabin, ma’am, and she ain’t
there. There weren’t nothing there but a red light
burning in the port-hole, ma’am.”</p>

<p>Caruth sprang to his feet, tearing the telephone-receiver
from his head. “A red light? Man, you’re
crazy!”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I ain’t, sir. There was a lantern wrapped
round with a red cloth burning in her port-hole.
And she’s gone, sir. She ain’t on board, sir; and Mr.
Wilkins ain’t on board either.”</p>

<p>For an instant Marie and Caruth stared at the
man in dumb silence. Then the girl realized the
situation. “Treachery!” she cried. “Treachery!
Wilkins has betrayed us! I never trusted him. He’s
betrayed us, and he’s carried the girl off.”</p>

<p>“Carried her off? It’s impossible!”</p>

<p>“Impossible or not, it’s been done. Maybe she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
went with him willingly—I don’t know and I don’t
care. She’s gone, and he’s gone, and there’s danger
in it! Danger! It means we are watched. It means
we’ll be attacked——”</p>

<p>“Attacked?”</p>

<p>“Yes, attacked! Do you think Russia will try
to arrest us? She couldn’t! We are within our
rights. We are only seeking salvage. She won’t
dare to arrest us. She’ll send ruffians to attack us
and kill or imprison us all. The <i>Sea Spume</i> will
disappear as the <i>Orkney</i> did. No one will ever hear
of it again. Quick! For God’s sake, give me that
telephone! I’ll stay here. Go and find Captain
Wilson! Serve out arms. Prepare to fight; for, as
God is my judge, we will have to fight or perish.
Don’t I know Russia and its police? Quick! The
murderers may be creeping on us now.”</p>

<p>In three steps Caruth was on deck, and in three
more on the bridge at Captain Wilson’s side. Eagerly
he poured out his story.</p>

<p>“If the police come for us openly, we must yield,”
he finished. “But Miss Fitzhugh says they will not
come openly. She says they will come as pirates,
thieves, murderers. If they do, we must fight for
our lives. We’re armed and——”</p>

<p>“We’ll do it! I’ll give orders.” The captain was
gone with the words trailing over his shoulders.</p>

<p>The <i>Sea Spume</i> had been bought and fitted out as
a dispatch boat by the United States Government
at the breaking out of the Spanish war. At its close,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
she had been sold, guns and all, to the highest bidder;
since then she had changed hands once or
twice, but none of her owners had dismantled her.
Finally Caruth, who had served on her during the
war with other boy members of the Naval Militia,
had bought her and had brought her up almost to
a man-of-war pitch. When he had started for Russia,
he had needed to add only a little ammunition to put
the yacht in condition to cope with anything of her
tonnage.</p>

<p>This armament was now to stand the adventurers
in good stead. Caruth, watching from the
bridge, saw the wave of excitement ripple along the
vessel at the captain’s low-spoken commands; saw
the tarpaulins jerked from the guns, revealing the
long black muzzles of the six-pound rapid-firers;
heard the splutter of the search-light as the men
tested its connection, and the rattle of the hoists as
the fixed ammunition, cartridge-like in ease of handling,
was brought upon the deck.</p>

<p>Suddenly all lights went out, and the <i>Sea Spume</i>
became only a darker spot in the opaque blackness
of the night. Simultaneously fell silence, profound
and tomblike!</p>

<p>Ghost-like, Captain Wilson mounted the bridge.
“Everything’s ready,” he reported in scarcely
audible tones. “If anybody comes for us now,
they’ll get a warm reception. The men are crazy
for a scrap.”</p>

<p>“Good! This means double pay all round,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Captain. You might pass the word. I’m going to
the cabin now to find out what news there is from
the divers. Miss Fitzhugh is at the telephone.”</p>

<p>But Caruth was not to go to the telephone then.
As his foot poised above the first step of the companionway,
from the bows a shrill challenge came.</p>

<p>“Boat ahoy! Boat ahoy! What boat is that?”</p>

<p>No answer came. But out in the darkness a voice
uplifted itself in short but swift command, intelligible
by its tone if not by its syllables. Unseen men
responded with an eager cheer, followed by a splash
of oars in the water.</p>

<p>“The search-light! Quick!” shouted Captain
Wilson, and at the word the electric sword glimmered
through the darkness, illuminating the black water,
and illuminating too, a score of boats, loaded with
men, dashing upon the yacht.</p>

<p>Small time was there for parley. “Aim! Fire!”
yelled the captain; and the flames of the guns split
the darkness, while their thunders echoed back
from the cliffs that towered close beside.</p>

<p>“Fire at will!” yelled Wilson, again; and again
the guns roared, not all together as before, but in a
pitter-patter of rattling sound. Swiftly the search-light
circled, picking out the boats for an instant
as vivid bull’s-eyes for the concentration of the yacht’s
fire; dancing away again to some fresh point.</p>

<p>The yachtsmen were poor gunners, but at that
range they could not miss. The revolving search-light
soon showed an inextricable tangle of boats,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
drifting or turning unbalanced athwart the course
of their companions, with oars dropping from dead
fingers and men plunging limply after them into
the embrace of the tide. Other boats showed for an
instant in the glare, then sank beneath the shimmering
water. But past and through all these, others
kept their way, intent only on coming to hand-grips
with the men of the yacht. In the gaps of sound, the
same ringing voice still sounded, as the unseen commander
incited his men to fresh efforts.</p>

<p>For a moment fate hung in the balance. Then,
as Caruth, pistol in hand, leaped down from the
ladder to join in repelling the boarders who seemed
about to swarm over the taffrail, the tide turned.
The Russians, overtaxed, bewildered, hesitated and
fled, some by boat, some by swimming; those who
had gained the yacht’s shrouds leaped back in
panic, careless whether planks or the Baltic lay beneath
them.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson’s deep voice rang out. “Cease
firing!” he shouted. “Cease firing!”</p>

<p>Silence followed storm. Then out of the night
came a flash and a roar. A jet of ruddy flame shot
from the cliff side toward the <i>Sea Spume</i> and the
skylight above the saloon vanished in a rain of
splinters and flying glass. The search-light, flung to
port, showed, high up on the cliffs, two heavy guns,
armed and manned.</p>

<p>Stupefied, the yachtsmen stared at them, unmoving,
till again came a flash and a report and a rending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
roar as the yacht quivered to the impact of a
shell.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson woke to life. “Fire on that
battery!” he yelled. “Mr. Caruth, get those divers
up. We can’t stay here.”</p>

<p>Blood flecked Caruth’s lip where he had bitten
it through. “What!” he cried. “Run away and
leave the gold to them? I won’t do it.”</p>

<p>“You must!”</p>

<p>“I won’t. I’ll——”</p>

<p>A hand fell on the young man’s arm. Marie
Fitzhugh stood beside him.</p>

<p>“The gold is gone,” she moaned.</p>

<p>“Gone!”</p>

<p>“Yes! The strong room on the <i>Orkney</i> has been
broken open. The boxes are there, but they are
empty. Some one has been before us. The gold
is gone.”</p>

<p>“Impossible.”</p>

<p>“It’s true. I ordered the divers on board. They
are coming over the side now. We must flee. Quick,
Captain! Full speed ahead.”</p>

<p>The engine bells clanged, and the yacht shook
to the throb of the screws. Rapidly she gathered
way. Another shot from the battery on the cliff
hissed over her, and still another went wide. Then
a turn in the channel shielded her from farther
danger.</p>

<p>It was not until half an hour later that it was
learned that Professor Shishkin had disappeared.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT full speed and without lights, the <i>Sea Spume</i>
rushed through the darkness, threading her
way among the islands by the faint light of
the stars reflected from the dancing water. Her
course was perilous in the extreme. At any moment
an unseen rock might rise in the way and
bring her to hopeless ruin. But delay was more
perilous than rocks, and the <i>Sea Spume</i> sped breathlessly
on.</p>

<p>Marie Fitzhugh was responsible both for the speed
and the course. As the yacht dashed from the inlet
into open water and veered southward, she climbed
to the bridge where Captain Wilson and Caruth were
standing.</p>

<p>“North! North, for your life, Captain!” she cried.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson grasped the engine-room indicator.
“Why north?” he demanded. “Stockholm
lies southwest.”</p>

<p>“We can never reach Stockholm. What! Do
you think escape is to be so easily made? No!
Russia has gone too far to stop now. The path to
the west and south—the path to any foreign port—is
guarded. To the north and east lies our only
chance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>Captain Wilson hesitated, but Caruth took control.
“North, please. Captain,” he commanded;
“and as fast as you dare.”</p>

<p>An instant more and the <i>Sea Spume</i> swept round,
heading northward around Burndo. As it turned,
the girl spoke again.</p>

<p>“I think their plan was to have us looted unofficially,”
she said, “and then, after they had
gotten the gold, to shoot a lot of the looters to satisfy
international conditions. But unless they are fools,
they must have prepared for just what has happened.
If half a dozen torpedo-boats are not hunting for us
this very minute, I miss my guess. Why they were
not waiting for us at the mouth of the inlet, I can’t
for the life of me understand, but if we get to port
without chancing on them, we shall be luckier
than I dare hope. They’ll never let us get away
with the gold—and of course they must think we
have it.”</p>

<p>“The gold! Who has got it?”</p>

<p>But instead of answering, the girl, with a half-choked
sob, hurried down the ladder, leaving the
two men alone.</p>

<p>Caruth hesitated for a moment, yearning to follow
and comfort her, yet uncertain whether it would
be best to do so.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson’s voice aroused him. “We’ll
be round the island in half an hour or more,” he
said gruffly. “Which way shall I head then?”</p>

<p>Caruth shook his head. “I don’t know, Captain,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
he confessed. “I’ll talk with Miss Fitzhugh, and
see what she thinks.”</p>

<p>“Might as well, I reckon. She’s got more brains
than most women.”</p>

<p>Swiftly Caruth descended to the cabin and there,
as he had expected, he found the girl who had been
the inspiration of the whole trip.</p>

<p>Seated at the table in the cabin of the <i>Sea Spume</i>,
Marie faced the ruin of her hopes. Indeed, she
faced more. For, as she had descended from the
bridge, one of the divers met her and commanded
her, by an authority she could not dispute, to report
at once to the Inner Circle of the Brotherhood, to
explain the causes of her failure. Well she knew
what such an order meant, and for the first time in
her life she shrank from the ordeal.</p>

<p>At that moment Caruth came upon her. Never,
even in her brief period of exaltation of a few hours
before, had she appealed to him as in this time of
abasement. Stricken by the realization of what had
been and what must be, she yet held her head proudly
erect, though its poise suggested, not triumph, but
the grand air with which nobles rode in the tumbrels
to the guillotine. Her violet eyes were deep as ever,
but in their depths lay a pathetic softness, as of a
child grieving over some disappointment which it
was too young to understand. When Caruth, with
throbbing heart, strode forward and took her in his
arms, she melted all at once upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>Gently he stroked her dark hair. “There, there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
sweetheart,” he murmured. “Cheer up! Everything
isn’t lost! We’ll live to triumph yet.”</p>

<p>But the girl sobbed on hopelessly, her slender
form shaking with emotion, until Caruth grew frightened.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, sweetheart,” he murmured again.
“Don’t take it so hard. It isn’t worth it, after all.
Come, dear, cheer up! There are other things in
the world besides plots and plotting. Marry me at
the first port we touch. Then, later, we can help
your cause all you like.”</p>

<p>Gently the girl freed herself and stood alone. On
her fair skin the color deepened from neck to temples;
her wet eyes glistened. A lock of hair had escaped
and trailed down over her forehead; she put it back
mechanically.</p>

<p>“No,” she said gently. “No, it can never be.”</p>

<p>“Never!” Once more Caruth caught her in his
arms. “Never!” he shouted. “By Heaven! I
swear it shall be!” Hotly he showered kisses upon
her hair, her face, her lips.</p>

<p>She did not resist. For the moment she could
not. A sense of intoxication numbed her faculties.
“Oh!” she breathed. “I did not know that it was
so sweet—so sweet!”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear; it is sweet. And it will continue sweet
through all the years to come. Can you not see those
years, dear one? Each with its own peculiar happiness,
yet each the same—for we shall be the same.
Yes, it is sweet, Marie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>Slowly the girl raised her face, and the tragedy
in her eyes appalled him. There was love in them,
love unutterable, but there was misery, too, misery,
hopeless, unspeakable. “I thank God!” she said
slowly. “I thank him for this moment. Whatever
comes, I thank him that he has given me to know
the love of a good man. See what it has done for
me. A little while ago I was afraid, afraid, afraid.
But now I fear no longer. I do not care what happens
now.”</p>

<p>“And you will marry me at the first port?”</p>

<p>Slowly the girl shook her head. She still rested
in his embrace, her dark eyes fixed on his. “No,”
she murmured. “No! I cannot.”</p>

<p>Dismay swept over Caruth. “But——” he began.</p>

<p>Gently she laid her fingers on his lips. “If it
could be,” she whispered—“if it could be, I would
count the world well lost. But it cannot be. Don’t
you understand, dear? I am vowed to help the
people, the poor, down-trodden people, who cannot
help themselves—who can only suffer. I cannot
desert them. I am sworn to them by vows as
holy as those of any nun. Success might have won
release, but I have failed.”</p>

<p>Caruth straightened himself indignantly. “Failed
nothing!” he cried. “You’ve not failed. There
is no failure where there is no chance of success.
The gold must have been gone before you ever saw
New York—before you ever heard of the matter at
all. You’ve done more than any one else could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
have done, for you’ve found the ship and explored
her. It isn’t your fault that somebody was before
you.”</p>

<p>Marie freed herself gently. “It isn’t a question
of fault,” she answered sadly. “It is a question of
success, and I have not succeeded. But, even so,
I fear it really is my fault. It would not be if you
were right—if the gold had indeed been taken when
you say. But I don’t think it was so taken. I believe
it was there when we left New York, even when we
arrived at Burndo. I feel that it was snatched away
under my very eyes. It was—— Good Heavens!
What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>For Caruth, suddenly weak, had dropped into a
chair. For the first time he had recalled the words
of the interpreter in the village. “Great Scott!” he
cried, “you are right. Why didn’t I think? Why
didn’t I guess? Fool, dolt, ass, that I am! I know
who got the gold.”</p>

<p>“Who?” Marie leaned forward with parted lips.</p>

<p>“The interpreter in the village. I told you something
of him, but I didn’t tell you enough. I didn’t
realize what it meant. I was a fool. He talked of
something—some gold mine, he said—that he needed
help to secure. He offered me a share. Then Wilkins
came up and he ran. By Heavens! I see it all now.
He knew Wilkins! He ran away to avoid explaining.
And I thought he was crazy! Oh, what an incredible
idiot I was!”</p>

<p>“It was fated!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“Fated nothing! It was plain idiocy. Oh, I see
it all now! Wilkins and he arranged it all. It’s
they that have the gold.”</p>

<p>“They and that girl.”</p>

<p>Caruth’s face clouded. “Do you think so?” he
questioned “She——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know all you would say. She is the Professor’s
daughter and all that; but she has fled with
Wilkins all the same. Trust a woman to know. She
has gone away with him willingly.”</p>

<p>“And the Professor?”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes filled with tears. “Oh, the poor
old man!” she cried. “The poor old man! So
courteous, so sweet, so kindly. I never knew my
father—he died when I was an infant—but I like
to think that if he had lived he would have been like
the Professor.”</p>

<p>“Then you don’t think he has gone with his
daughter?”</p>

<p>“What! Gone with her? Never! Why, he was
on board long after they had disappeared. He must
have been knocked overboard in the fight.”</p>

<p>Caruth nodded. “I agree with you, of course,”
he responded. “No one could suspect the old man,
even if circumstances were against him, which they
are not. But what of the others? Do you think
they will escape?”</p>

<p>“For the moment perhaps. Not for long. I did
not speak idly when I warned Wilkins in New York.
Neither he nor the girl will live to enjoy the fruits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
of their treachery.” Dangerously the dark eyes
flashed.</p>

<p>Caruth shuddered. “You wouldn’t set the nihilists
on them?” he protested blankly.</p>

<p>“There is no need. Think you I could screen
them if I would! No! I am not the only member
of the Order on board. The Brotherhood has its
agents everywhere. At this very moment, it probably
understands better than we what has happened.
Who should know its methods if not I? We shall
all have to answer for our failure—I, Professor
Shishkin if he lives, and, most of all, his daughter
and her lover. I have already been summoned before
the Inner Circle. The order was given me ten
minutes ago.”</p>

<p>She paused, hesitated for a moment, then raised
her head proudly. “We have all made our beds,”
she declared. “Let us lie in them. I, for one, shall
not flinch. What port is the yacht heading for?”</p>

<p>The moment for sentiment had passed, and the
girl was herself again, cold, clear-headed, self-reliant.
Caruth realized the fact and bowed to it.</p>

<p>“I came to consult you about that,” he explained.
“We are about around the islands now, and must
decide on our course. Where shall we go?”</p>

<p>“There is but one place. St. Petersburg.”</p>

<p>“St. Petersburg?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We can be there by daylight to-morrow,
and by breakfast you can reach your ambassador.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“What for?” echoed the girl amazedly. “What
for? Your yacht, a private American yacht, engaged
in a lawful occupation, has been attacked and fired
on in Russian waters. Three of her passengers,
one of them a distinguished scientist, have disappeared.
You must complain; appeal to your ambassador;
demand the identification and punishment
of the offenders. Things like that cannot be done
with impunity, even by Russia, unless they succeed
so fully that they blot out their own traces. This
time some one has blundered, and they will strive
desperately to retrieve themselves. If you attempted
to seek another port, you would find yourself denounced
as a criminal who had fired on inoffensive
fishing-boats. No! No! The boldest course is
the best. Take the bull by the horns. Run to St.
Petersburg, and have the ambassador present the
case to the Czar in person. Once your complaint
is filed, you are at least safe from murder.”</p>

<p>Caruth nodded. The advice was good. “I’ll
tell the captain,” he acceded. “Now promise me
you will try to get some sleep.”</p>

<p>Marie laughed cheerlessly. “Oh, yes, I’ll try,”
she promised; “but I feel as if I should never sleep
again.”</p>

<p>When Caruth reached the deck, the night was far
gone, and streaks of light were already glimmering
in the east. Not being in the mood for sleep, he
stayed and watched the dawn come up.</p>

<p>Uneventfully the moments sped past, and at last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the golden ball of the sun lifted itself above the
horizon, sending long lances of light ricocheting
over the dancing waters.</p>

<p>There was a twang in the air; the salt sea breeze
thrummed in the rigging; in spite of himself, Caruth
caught the uplift of the day. All was not hopeless,
he told himself, with the buoyancy of his youth and
his race, to which all things are possible. He had
lost the first inning. “I’ll win her yet!” he cried
aloud. “I’ll win her yet.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIRTY-SIX hours later the <i>Sea Spume</i> lay in
harbor at St. Petersburg, and Caruth had
told his story to the American <i>Chargé d’Affaires</i>,
who was conducting matters in the absence
of the ambassador. As he stepped out of the office
of the <i>Chargé</i>, he heard his name called in wondering
tones.</p>

<p>The accents seemed familiar, and he whirled
round. Then he started in amazement and held
out his hand.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, Bristow!” he cried. “Where on
earth did you spring from?”</p>

<p>The reporter grinned back at him. “Seems kind
of funny, doesn’t it?” he answered. “But, shucks,
this is a small world nowadays, and you oughtn’t
to be surprised at meeting anybody.”</p>

<p>Caruth disregarded the persiflage. “Well!” he
declared heartily. “I don’t know any man in the
world I’d rather see. Your arrival is a regular Godsend.
How did it come about?”</p>

<p>“Most natural thing in the world. The Consolidated
Press man at St. Petersburg has been wanting
for a year or two to come home on a long vacation,
but they never could spare him. A few weeks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
ago, when things were quieter than they had been
for some time, I asked them to send me over to relieve
him. When I told them I could speak a little Russian,
they agreed right away. I left New York two days
after you did.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you wanted to come to Russia.”</p>

<p>The reporter grinned. “I didn’t know it either
a month ago,” he responded. “But I got married
and——”</p>

<p>“Married? Good for you! Accept congratulations!”</p>

<p>“Thank you. My wife wanted to visit Russia
in a hurry, and so—here we are. But that’s enough
about me. How about yourself? There’s an incendiary
tale afloat about your doings. Any truth in
it?”</p>

<p>“Too much! Come over here and sit down, and
I’ll tell you the whole story.”</p>

<p>Rapidly, Caruth poured his tale into the reporter’s
sympathetic ears. He kept nothing back, as he had
done in his first talk in New York. He told about
Wilkins’s arrival; explained about the letters; and
sketched rapidly the organization and the departure
of the expedition and the events, so far as he knew
them, that had taken place at Burndo Island.</p>

<p>“The situation is all in a muddle,” he ended. “I
suppose Wilkins got away with the gold, though I
can’t imagine how he did it. And I suppose the Professor
was knocked overboard and drowned. But
I can’t understand what has become of the girl.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Bristow leaned back in his chair. “If I remember
correctly,” he premised slowly, “I favored you in
New York with certain moralizations on the way
events fit in together. I’ll add to that now that if
you hunt back far enough, you can find a common
cause for a good many events that at first blush seem
unrelated. You don’t know it, of course, but I have
a direct personal interest in this affair. You see, I
have known Professor Shishkin and his daughter
for several years. In fact, Miss Shishkin is now my
wife.”</p>

<p>“What!” Caruth half rose from his seat.</p>

<p>“Take it easy! I don’t mean that the girl you
had on board this yacht is my wife. God forbid!
As a matter of fact, that lady is not Professor Shishkin’s
daughter at all. She is an alleged actress,
drafted from the music hall stage by the Professor
and cast for the part of his daughter. Now perhaps
you begin to see a glimmer of light.”</p>

<p>But Caruth shook his head. “No, I don’t,” he
returned. “Why should Professor Shishkin palm
off somebody else as his daughter? It’s all a tangle
of fraud and deceit. You go on and explain,
please. My brain is buzzing.”</p>

<p>“It’s simple enough. The nihilists had ordered
the Professor to bring his daughter with him on this
trip, and he didn’t want to do it. Just why he objected,
I’m not sure, though I have my suspicions;
but he did object most strenuously. But he didn’t
dare to refuse either to go on this expedition or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
to take his daughter. He was half mad when I
went to him and asked for Olga. To cut it short,
he agreed that I might marry her if I would find a
substitute who looked like her and who would go in
her place. I did find such a substitute in the person
of Miss Florence Lee, the lady who accompanied
your expedition. She was always a cold-blooded,
calculating piece, for all her mask of flippancy, and
I guess she and Wilkins framed it up between them
to sell out. Now do you see?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see.” Caruth spoke heavily. “Why
didn’t you put me on?” he asked. “If I had known,
I might have prevented all this.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t have prevented it. I’m absolutely
certain that your expedition has been watched,
almost from the first. It was madness for Miss
Fitzhugh to think she could succeed. Besides, you
didn’t take me into your confidence or ask my
advice; and, even if you had, I should probably have
been compelled to keep silence for the sake of my
wife and father-in-law. For—make no mistake
about this, Caruth—what I have told you must go
no further. The Professor may be dead, as you
suppose, but Olga is alive, and I don’t want to draw
any nihilist vengeance on her. You mustn’t talk.”</p>

<p>“I won’t.”</p>

<p>“The situation is reasonably clear now, isn’t it,
except about how those fellows got the gold and
where they have taken it? But I guess you’d better
put the gold out of your mind. Wherever it is, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
out of reach, and a good thing, too. Of course, as
a matter of salvage, the finder of an abandoned
wreck is entitled to the bigger part of her value. But
when the finders have deliberately brought about
the wreck, the ethics of the case get mixed. I
think you’ll be glad some day that you missed it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps! If I get the girl! Not unless. Great
Scott, Bristow. I’d do worse than steal for Marie’s
sake! You’ve just been married yourself, and you
know how it is.”</p>

<p>Bristow grinned. “So it’s got to the ‘Marie’
point, now, has it? By the way, where is the lady?”</p>

<p>“Gone! The moment we got here, she left the
ship, saying that she had been summoned before the
Inner Circle—whatever that is.”</p>

<p>Bristow whistled softly. “I suppose you will wait
for her to return?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“I shall. I have nothing else to wait for. The
whole trip has been a flat failure, and there is nothing
for me to do but to sneak back to New York with
my tail between my legs. I wouldn’t mind if she
would go with me, but I fear——”</p>

<p>His voice died gloomily away.</p>

<p>Bristow laughed unfeelingly. “Well,” he said,
“others have failed before and will fail hereafter.
You aren’t the only one. And—though you may
not believe it—‘men have died and worms have
eaten them, but not for love.’ Things will seem
brighter after awhile. Have you found out who she
is yet?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>Caruth shook his head. “I don’t care,” he
answered frankly. “She told me her mother was
an American, and—oh, well, she is she. That’s
enough.”</p>

<p>“I might find out for you,” suggested the reporter.
“I’ve got sources of information that most men
haven’t. I’ve only been here a short while, but I’ve
learned a lot about the nihilists. Forbes, my predecessor
here, established relations with them and
built up a wonderful news system, to which, of course,
I have fallen heir.”</p>

<p>“Do the nihilists trust you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly. Revolutionists all over the world
trust American newspaper men. It’s positively
marvellous how the most secretive conspirator will
put his life in our hands. It speaks pretty well for
the profession.”</p>

<p>“It does.”</p>

<p>“I can use my pull to find out who your charmer
is, if you like?”</p>

<p>But Caruth shook his head. “No,” he said
slowly. “If she had wanted me to know, she would
have told me. Thank you; but—never mind.”</p>

<p>“Just as you like. I’ve got to look my nihilist
friends up, any way, to see if they have any news
from Burndo. Their system of communication beats
the government’s sometimes.”</p>

<p>“How can it?”</p>

<p>“Search me! But I know that it does. Information
seems to travel faster underground than it does<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
in the air. The only trouble is that it’s spotty—not
complete. A man may know every detail of one circumstance
and be totally ignorant of another that
you’d think he couldn’t help but know. But tell
me once more about the Professor—when and how
you last saw him. Olga will be in despair over his
death. I suppose you can’t give me any hope?”</p>

<p>Caruth shook his head. He could give none.
Everything seemed to point to the Professor having
been knocked overboard and lost. If not, he must
have been captured, and this seemed improbable
under the circumstances. Caruth explained all this,
going over the circumstances again and again.</p>

<p>At last the reporter nodded. “I’m afraid it’s
good-night for the poor old fellow,” he concluded
sadly. “It’s some comfort that he never knew that
his plan failed. Yes, I guess it’s good-by.” The
reporter rose. “Well, I must be off,” he finished.
“I suppose you are willing that I should use my
own judgment as to what I wire to New York about
this scrape of yours. I’ll make things as easy as
possible for you, of course.”</p>

<p>“Very well. I’ll leave all that to you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FRIDAY, the 13th of June, one week after the
day the <i>Sea Spume</i> had scurried into St.
Petersburg, came without making any apparent
change in the situation. Nothing had been
learned as to the fate of Professor Shishkin, and both
Bristow and Caruth were convinced that the old man
had perished. Wilkins and Florence had not been
heard from, despite the fact that the entire Baltic was
lined with spies, police and nihilistic, each intent on
regaining the gold which all parties had become
convinced was in the possession of the pair. Their
sloop and its precious cargo seemed to have vanished
from the earth.</p>

<p>The Russian authorities were still “investigating”
the attack on the yacht, without seeming to draw
any nearer to an elucidation of the facts. They had
called before them and questioned every member
of the yacht’s crew. These, however, had been able
to tell little, for the reason that they knew little,
and, being intensely loyal to Caruth, were all anxious
to keep that little to themselves. The inquiry was,
in fact, a farce, the Russians knowing perfectly
well what the yacht’s errand really had been, yet
not being able to declare it or to lay claim to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
<i>Orkney’s</i> gold without practically admitting that
they had been back of the attack. On the other
hand, Caruth could not accuse the Russians, without
admitting that he himself was engaged in an adventure
that, if not actually piratical, certainly verged
on it.</p>

<p>Neither side was therefore in position to force the
issue, and the inquiry dragged on from day to day,
really waiting the moment when it would be quietly
pigeonholed. Both sides steadily went through the
motions of pretending desperate efforts to discover
what both knew and both were very anxious to keep
secret. If it had not been for the disappearance of
Professor Shishkin, the whole matter would probably
have been allowed to drop.</p>

<p>Professor Shishkin, however, was too distinguished
a man to be allowed to drop out of sight so easily.
His scientific brethren, especially those in the rest
of Europe, were clamoring for an explanation of an
attack on one of their number while engaged in scientific
work in such a peaceable sea as the Baltic.
Hints that the Professor had really been engaged in
gold-hunting and that the attack had been made by
a gang of thieves, had little effect in calming the
agitation. They were simply disbelieved.</p>

<p>Bristow’s inquiries in revolutionary circles had
brought abundant confirmation of what he already
knew, but had yielded little additional information.</p>

<p>According to the nihilists, the whole affair had been
carefully planned by the Russian police. A battalion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
of marines had been landed at the village of Burndo
on the very afternoon of the attack, reaching it by
the eastern inlet, and had climbed over the ridge
and come down the hill behind the yacht, bringing
two field-guns with them. As Miss Fitzhugh had
guessed, the men were in peasant dress, and it was
intended that they should appear to be a band of
rioters such as were only too common in Russia in
those troubled times. It was supposed that they
would capture the yacht without trouble, loot her,
and let her go, after perhaps murdering the Russians
whom they should find on board. However, lest
they should fail, several gunboats and destroyers
had been ordered to the spot to intercept the yacht
if she should escape. The orders to these were far
more grim.</p>

<p>This plan was disarranged by the suddenness
with which Florence exposed her signal, and by the
haste of the officer in command of the Russian troops.
When the sparks from the yacht’s funnels showed
that she was getting up steam, this officer feared she
was about to flee with the gold, and, wanting the
credit of capturing this, had made his attack before
the field-guns were in position and before the gunboats
had arrived off the mouth of the inlet. Had
he moved a half an hour later, the <i>Sea Spume</i> would
have been captured or sunk by the hurrying warships.</p>

<p>Concerning the gold, the information was less
exact. The nihilists had learned, however, that a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
sloop, very heavily laden, carrying two men and one
woman, had left Burndo for an unknown destination
a few moments before the <i>Sea Spume</i>. It had
turned south outside the mouth of the inlet, and had
passed beyond the ken of the watchers. Probably it
was bound for Stockholm or some other foreign port.
Its passengers had been identified as Wilkins and
Miss Shishkin (really Florence Lee); the third man
was unknown, but it was supposed that he was an
American sailor who had been living at Burndo for
two years or more.</p>

<p>The nihilists felt assured that this sloop had the
gold on board, though how it got there, they did not
profess to know. Orders had been sent all along
the Baltic to watch for it, and if it was found, it
would go hard with those on board.</p>

<p>None of this, however, was much satisfaction to
Caruth, to whom, indeed, the week had been one
of torture. Since Marie Fitzhugh had slipped away
on the morning of the yacht’s arrival, no word of her
had come to him, and his anxiety as to her safety
was continually growing. Events had shown that
the <i>Sea Spume</i> had been under surveillance for some
time, possibly from the very beginning, and Caruth
realized that this could scarcely have been possible
without Marie having been seen and recognized. If
she had been, her carefully arranged alibi must have
been shattered, and instant arrest would assuredly
follow her detection on Russian soil.</p>

<p>Even if she escaped the authorities, or if her family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
connections proved strong enough to enable her to
defy them, the disappointed and enraged terrorists
had to be considered. She had been ordered before
the Inner Circle, and such vague and illusory information
as he had been able to gain as to the doings
of that body made him fear almost anything. At
the same time, he dared not start inquiries, for fear
they might precipitate the very calamity he dreaded.</p>

<p>On the morning of his seventh day in St. Petersburg,
he could bear the suspense no longer, and
turned to Bristow with a demand that he relieve it,
as he had done on that far-away evening in New
York.</p>

<p>“I seem to be always relying on you to find Miss
Fitzhugh for me,” he said, with an attempt at levity.
“But if you really have sources of information here
that are safe and certain, I wish you would call on
them for news of her. The suspense is getting unbearable.”</p>

<p>Bristow frowned slightly. “I don’t suppose there’s
any use in talking,” he observed. “You wouldn’t
take my advice in New York, and I don’t suppose
you’ll take it here. But all the same, I’m going to
suggest once more that you’d better let the lady go.
As I understand it, she has refused to marry you and
has gone back to her own people. Why not go back
home and forget her. Candidly, old man, I can’t
see anything but ruin ahead for you if you go on.”</p>

<p>As the reporter spoke, a slow flush spread over
Caruth’s cheeks. The boy had aged a good deal in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
the past month; experience had made him far more
of a man than he had been when Marie Fitzhugh
first came to him. Advice which he had received
meekly in New York, he resented in Russia.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” he returned stiffly. “I don’t
doubt your advice is good. I should probably say
the same to another man under the same circumstances.
But please understand, once for all, that
it is not for me. The only question is, will you help
me or shall I have to seek farther?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll help you, confound you!” returned the
reporter. “What do you want to know?”</p>

<p>“I want to know about Miss Fitzhugh. If she
has gone back to her relatives and is safe and well,
I want to know it. If she is under arrest, I want
to know it. If she is in trouble with the Brotherhood
on account of the loss of the gold, I want to
know it. And wherever she is, if she needs help, I
want to get to her and give it.”</p>

<p>“Humph! That’s a good-sized program you’ve
laid out, isn’t it? Well, the Lord watches over
children, lovers, and—well, fill the blank yourself.
I can give you some news. I heard it last night, and
was debating whether to tell you or not. Miss
Fitzhugh is in trouble with the Brotherhood. She
is charged with responsibility for the loss of the gold.
A special meeting is to be held to consider her case.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“As I understand it, when any one has failed at
anything and is summoned before the Inner Circle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
it means that he or she is to be entrusted with some
particularly dangerous duty. Some forlorn hope,
such as throwing a bomb or something,—not as a
punishment, you understand, but as a chance to
retrieve the failure. Such a chance means almost
certain death, either instant or later on the scaffold.
I’m sorry, old man; I know it’s hard to bear, and I
guess it’s best to tell you.”</p>

<p>Caruth’s face was white, but his jaws were set.
He passed by the reporter’s regrets as though they
had not been spoken.</p>

<p>“You speak as if it were all settled,” he grated.
“Is it?”</p>

<p>“Not yet. But it will be. There is no real doubt.”</p>

<p>“When and where does the Inner Circle meet?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but——”</p>

<p>“Can you find out?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. But——”</p>

<p>“I must be there.”</p>

<p>The reporter straightened himself. “That’s
impossible,” he declared.</p>

<p>“Nothing is impossible!” There was an accent
in Caruth’s voice that Bristow had never heard
before. “Send word at once through your channels
that I wish to appear before the Circle as a witness
for Miss Fitzhugh. Say that I will submit to any
and all conditions it cares to impose. Add that I
am very rich and will be glad to contribute heavily
to the cause in return for this privilege. Let them
name their price and I will pay it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Bristow weakened, impressed in spite of himself.
“By Jove!” he cried. “It might be done, after all.
But you understand what it means! There is always
grave danger of these meetings being raided by the
police. If you were caught at one of them, nothing
could save you. It would be death or life in prison——”</p>

<p>“I understand! I’ll take the risk! I’ll take any
risk, only get me the chance.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll try. But we’ll have to be mighty
careful. Demidroff is awfully keen on getting this
gold. In fact, rumor says his job depends on it.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Demidroff?”</p>

<p>“He’s chief of the third section of Russian police—the
secret police, you know. I wonder you haven’t
heard of him. He’s the smartest and the most
dreaded man in Russia to-day; to-morrow—well,
they do say that his enemies have gotten the ear of
the Emperor, and that he is likely to be turned out
any minute. However, he isn’t down and out yet
and may never be, and he’s keeping a mighty sharp
watch on you. So you’ll have to be careful.”</p>

<p>“I will be.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll do my best for you. Hold yourself
ready to start at any minute. When the chance
comes it won’t wait.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWENTY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BRISTOW’S efforts to secure Caruth an audience
before the Inner Circle proved more successful
than the reporter had dared to hope.
His request, once started on its way, was transmitted
with what seemed to him amazing rapidity:
so quickly, in fact, did the answer come back that
he would have questioned its authenticity had not
the proof of this been unimpeachable.</p>

<p>The Inner Circle, it appeared, was as anxious
to see Caruth as Caruth was to see it. The answer
fixed the very next afternoon for the interview.
Caruth was notified to go for a stroll on the Nevski
Prospekt, and to submit himself to the guidance
of a man who would accost him there and utter
certain pass-words.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the next afternoon saw Caruth strolling
along the designated roadway, staring at the
brilliant equipages that crowded that fashionable
drive, and rubbing shoulders with the cosmopolitan
crowd that passed and repassed.</p>

<p>The season was over, and gay St. Petersburg was
fleeing away from the capital over which the annual
shadow of malaria was slowly growing. Enough
remained, however, to illustrate Russian life; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
many tourists still lingered, lending color to the
scene. Not often, Caruth thought, had he seen so
many ornamental women gathered together.</p>

<p>His thoughts, however, were not on women, but
on the guide who was to meet him and lead him before
the council. Which of the tall, bearded men that
pressed by him, he wondered, would turn out to be
the messenger?</p>

<p>“Trouble you for a light, mister?”</p>

<p>Caruth turned. A young fellow, by all signs an
American tourist, was reaching out his hand for
the cigar Caruth held between his lips.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” continued the young man lightly,
as he returned the weed. “I spotted you for an
American the minute I saw you. I can always tell.
Everybody can’t. I’m an American, too. Did you
guess? Whence did you come, brother?”</p>

<p>Caruth started. The words were part of the prescribed
ritual whereby he was to know his guide.
But could this——</p>

<p>“From the land of the free and the home of the
brave,” he answered unwillingly. Never before
had the patriotic words seemed to him quite so
bombastic.</p>

<p>“I’m from the House of the Three Feathers myself,”
returned the stranger jauntily, completing
the ritual. “Come and have a wet. They’ve got a
bar over here where you can get drinks like the eagle
used to make. Come along!”</p>

<p>Caruth dropped into line beside his interlocutor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
who, still talking loudly and volubly, led him into
a café, around a partition, and then with an admonitory
“Look sharp now,” darted down a flight of
stairs, followed a long passage, and finally came out
into another street, where a cab was waiting. Into
this he jumped, Caruth following.</p>

<p>Before the door was closed, the driver whipped up
his horses and the cab darted off at the breakneck
speed characteristic of the Russian jehus. As it
began to move, the young man turned to Caruth and
spoke quietly, without a trace of his former levity.
“We are going to the railway station,” he explained,
“and will have just time to catch a train. Be ready
to follow me promptly.”</p>

<p>Conversation was difficult in the swaying cab,
and indeed there was little time for it, for in less than
ten minutes the cab drew up before the railway
station and the young man leaped out and tore toward
the gate, Caruth at his heels. Scarcely had they
passed through when it clanged behind them.</p>

<p>“Close shave that,” remarked the other, when the
two were seated and the train was rolling southward.
“I came mighty near cutting it too fine.
However, all’s well that ends well. Now, we’ve got
an hour’s ride before us, and might as well make
ourselves comfortable.”</p>

<p>Caruth’s lips opened. He was about to ask a
question, when the other interposed. “Curiosity
killed a cat,” he murmured. “Where ignorance is
bliss, etc. Ask me no questions and I’ll tell you no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
lies. Talk about the weather if you can’t think of
anything else, but don’t be inquisitive. Pretty
country this—if you don’t mind what you say!”</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Caruth made no attempt to question
his mentor, but chatted on indifferent subjects
till the train stopped at Gatchina, where the two
left it and entered a cab, which at once started off at
the usual speed. “I’ll leave you in a moment now,”
said the other quietly. “Stay in the cab. The driver
has his orders and has been paid. When he stops
in front of a house, No. 351, go up to the door and
walk in without ringing. You will be expected.”</p>

<p>His instructions finished, the young fellow turned
the handle of the door. “Au revoir,” he said, and
leaped out as the cab swung round a corner.</p>

<p>Caruth caught and closed the swinging door, and
sat back to await events. Evidently the men he was
to see took good precautions to keep their meeting
place secure.</p>

<p>The drive did not last long. It ended in a street
of cheap looking houses, over the door of one of which
Caruth descried the number 351. Promptly he
dismounted and walked up the steps, noting that
his cab drove away the moment he left it. The
next instant he had opened the door and stepped
into a dimly lighted hall.</p>

<p>A man seated on the foot of a flight of stairs that
led upward rose as Caruth entered and glanced at
him sharply, then made way for him to pass, jerking
his thumb over his shoulder as a direction. He added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
something, probably a word of instruction, but as
it was in Russian the American could not profit by it.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs Caruth hesitated for a
moment, then tapped at a doorway whence came
the low sound of voices. Some one answered, presumably
in invitation to enter, and Caruth opened
the door and went in.</p>

<p>Half a dozen men seated around a table looked
up as he entered, and the one at the head addressed
him in fair English.</p>

<p>“Mr. Caruth?” he questioned. “Yes? I am
Sergius Lermantoff. Take a seat, please, Mr.
Caruth.”</p>

<p>Caruth sat down with a strong feeling of disappointment.
Could these be the members of the
famous Inner Circle, before which the mighty Czar
quailed, and under whose menace the atrocities
formerly perpetrated on helpless prisoners had
recently come to an end? Certainly they did not
look it! Four of them appeared to be stolid peasants,
and the other two, including the leader, while more
intelligent-looking, did not look at all above the grade
of the average immigrant whom Caruth had often
seen trailing up town from Castle Garden. Could
it be that such men as this held the destinies of a
girl like Marie in their hands?</p>

<p>Lermantoff addressed him again. “The Brotherhood
wishes to thank you, Mr. Caruth, for your
kindness in placing your yacht at its disposal in the
endeavor to regain the treasure of the <i>Orkney</i>. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
would be glad if you would answer it some questions
about the circumstance at Burndo. I am the only
one here who speaks English, so I must act as
interpreter.”</p>

<p>Caruth nodded, glad enough to give any information
that might dispose the Circle favorably toward
him later in the proceedings.</p>

<p>“I’ll answer them with pleasure,” he responded.</p>

<p>Then followed a series of questions regarding the
trip of the <i>Sea Spume</i>, and the details of her stay
at Burndo, all tending to elucidate every phase of
the proceedings. Taken together, they amounted
to a cross-examination as keen and searching as any
he had ever known in a New York court-room.
Under their spur, Caruth felt his respect for the
other rising and began to understand why he had
attained his present power.</p>

<p>At last the examination ended. Lermantoff
translated the last answer to his companions; then
turned back to Caruth. “Now, Mr. Caruth——” he
said.</p>

<p>During the questioning Caruth had studied every
detail of the room, hoping to find something that
would show the presence near at hand of the girl
on whom he had set his heart; but he had looked
in vain. Now at last, with a tightening around his
heart, he realized that his time had come, and he
summoned all his faculties for the contest.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lermantoff,” he began, “you understand,
of course, that I embarked in this enterprise for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
selfish motives. I make no pretenses. I sympathize
with the Russian people in their fight for liberty,
but I did not and do not sympathize with them
enough to risk my life and liberty for their sake.
I came to Russia simply and solely because I
hoped to aid the lady whom I know only as Marie
Fitzhugh.”</p>

<p>The leader nodded. “Most men have selfish or
partly selfish motives for what they do,” he agreed,
with a suspicion of a smile. “Your motive is quite
clear; I take it you expected Marie Fitzhugh to
reward you.”</p>

<p>“I hoped she might. From the moment I saw
her, I wanted her for my wife. That was why I
kept silence in New York when my valet was murdered,
and thereby saved your scheme from being
wrecked at the outset. That was why I came to
Russia. That is why I am here.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did she tell you? Why do you come
to us?”</p>

<p>Caruth threw out his hands. “Don’t fence with
me,” he protested. “You know what she told me.
You know you took her vows—the vows of a mere
child—to devote her life and her beauty to your
cause. You know that you are holding her practically
for sale to the highest bidder—to him who will do
most for that cause. It isn’t fair! It is an outrage
on womanhood. It is trafficking in all that is holiest
and highest in life. No cause will prosper that depends
on such methods. Be advised! She has done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
her best for you. She has done more than most
women could do. Release her! Let her marry me—if
she will.”</p>

<p>Caruth’s breath came quick and fast. His words
tumbled over each other. With outflung hands,
he leaned forward across the heavy table.</p>

<p>Thoughtfully Lermantoff studied his face. “Mr.
Caruth,” he said slowly, “all your life you have had
everything you wanted. This is probably the first
time you have had to fight and wait and hope for
anything. You find it hard. Further, you are young.
Your own happiness and the girl’s seem to you the
most important things in the world. Really, they
are not. What difference will it make to the world
one hundred years from now whether you two
marry or not? But it will make a great difference
one hundred years from now whether the Russian
people have won their freedom or not. We have
trained Marie Fitzhugh for the work she has to do.
We have no one in all the Brotherhood who can do
that work so well. To give her up—to surrender
this tool that we have fashioned so carefully—is to
set back the cause by no one knows how many years.
Consider a moment, Mr. Caruth! She went to New
York and enlisted your coöperation with all your
wealth and influence within an hour after she had
landed. And do not think that it was all her beauty;
it was more—it was her personality. Do I not know
it? Have I not felt it myself?”</p>

<p>The speaker paused. Caruth, reading an unsuspected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
meaning in his last words and foreseeing
complications, caught his breath, but Lermantoff
gave him no time to consider. With unmistakable,
though suppressed, emotion, he went on:</p>

<p>“Such powers as hers are mighty, not to be thrown
lightly away. They have been reserved for some
great end, for some moment when they might turn
the scale of Russia’s destiny. For this reason I have
denied myself.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Yes! I tell you! Myself!” The man leaned
forward, face aglow. His sinewy hands, clinched,
thundered on the table. “What! Think you I have
lived beside her and not loved her? Am I a dolt or
a stone? Am I less a man because I am pledged to
the Brotherhood? No, no, Mr. Caruth! I love her,
love her—and I have denied myself. Shall I now
yield her to you?”</p>

<p>Both men had forgotten the others. They might
have been alone in a wilderness, for all heed they
took of listeners. The one subject in their minds
swallowed up all else.</p>

<p>Caruth moistened his dry lips. “She does not
love you,” he muttered despairingly.</p>

<p>Lermantoff sank back, the fire dying from his
eyes. “No,” he answered sadly; “she does not love
me. Perhaps that was why. Oh, we are poor creatures,
we men! We do not even know our own
motives.” He brushed back a lock of hair that had
fallen over his brow. “She does not love me, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
she does love you. Therefore—oh, I am a sentimentalist
after all—therefore, I would give her to
you, were it even at Russia’s expense, if I alone had
the power. But I have not. I am only one. The
interests of the Brotherhood must be consulted.”</p>

<p>“What does the Brotherhood demand?” Caruth’s
tones were firmer now. Hope had begun to glimmer.</p>

<p>“The Brotherhood has fashioned a tool for its
use; you want that tool. The Brotherhood will
not—dare not—give it to you. But the Brotherhood
is poor, and you are rich. It will sell it to you—at a
great price. What will you give?”</p>

<p>Caruth moved restlessly. It was shocking to him
that Marie should be made a subject of bargain and
sale. “I cannot chaffer over such a subject,” he
cried. “Tell me what you want, and I will pay it
if it is in my power. You say right. I am rich—not
rich like many of my countrymen, but rich by
ordinary standards. Tell me what you want, and
I will pay it if I can.”</p>

<p>“The Brotherhood wants a million dollars.”</p>

<p>Caruth did not hesitate. “You shall have it,”
he answered. “But you will have to give me time
to get it for you. I have not a tithe of the sum in
ready cash. I shall have to go to New York and
sell property. It may take two months. I will give
you my note for the sum at two months if you will
take it.”</p>

<p>Lermantoff bowed. “We will take it,” he
answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“And—and—you will trust me? I may take her
away with me?”</p>

<p>“Assuredly! But the Brotherhood trusts no one;
it has no need to do so. Marie Fitzhugh will be as
much within its reach in New York as she is in this
house. No one can betray or deceive the Brotherhood
and live to enjoy it.”</p>

<p>Caruth’s face grew stern. “I understand that
this million dollars buys the lady’s release absolutely.
You will give up all hold on her, all claim over her.
You will tell her so, and release her from her vows
in my presence?”</p>

<p>Lermantoff nodded. “That is the understanding,”
he said. Turning, he said a few words to the man
by his side, and that individual rose and went out.
“I have sent for Marie,” he explained.</p>

<p>Caruth sprang to his feet. “You—you will not
tell her that I have—have bought her?” he pleaded.</p>

<p>The other shook his head. “Have no fear,” he
answered gently. “Remember! I love her too.”</p>

<p>In a moment the man was back. With him came
Marie. When she saw Caruth, she stopped short,
gasping, with distended eyes. “You!” she muttered.
“You here!”</p>

<p>Caruth caught both her hands in his. “Yes!”
he cried. “Yes! And it’s all right! All right! The
Brotherhood has given you to me.”</p>

<p>With joy dawning in her frightened eyes, the girl
turned to the others.</p>

</figure>

<p>Lermantoff caught her glance and nodded.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>“Marie Fitzhugh,” he said solemnly, “for reasons
that seem good to it, the Brotherhood has decided
to send you to America to aid in creating sympathy
for the Russian people there. You will go with Mr.
Caruth to St. Petersburg, to the American Embassy,
and marry him there, and go with him to the United
States. You are hereby released from all obligations
to the Brotherhood and from all your vows.
Such service as you may render hereafter will be
purely voluntary. As chief of the Brotherhood, I
tell you this in Mr. Caruth’s presence. The other
members of the Circle will now confirm it to you.”</p>

<p>He turned and spoke a few words in Russian, and
one by one each of the other members repeated what
seemed to Caruth to be a set form of words. When
they had finished, Lermantoff spoke again.</p>

<p>“You are not entirely out of danger yet, Mr.
Caruth,” he warned. “Baron Demidroff is making
desperate efforts to capture Marie, and she will be
arrested if found. That is why she has remained
concealed here. Once you have made her your wife
at the American Embassy, she will be measurably
safe. Until then, she will be in danger. I think,
therefore, that she had better go with you in disguise.
Tell me good-by now, my child, and go and get
ready. I hope you will be very, very happy.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS the train drew away from Gatchina, Caruth
drew a long breath of relief. Running express,
it would make no stops on the way to
St. Petersburg, scarcely an hour distant, and little
was likely to happen in an hour. Humanly speaking,
he felt that Marie was safe.</p>

<p>Quickly the speed increased as the suburbs of the
town whisked by, and almost in a moment the train
was running through open fields. Then might the
peasants along the track, if gifted with sufficiently
quick eyesight, have seen in one of the compartments
a fashionably dressed young man ecstatically embracing
what seemed to be a workingman.</p>

<p>Marie wore the dress of a laborer. Her lovely
hair, coiled on top of her head, was concealed beneath
a rough cap. Her coat collar, turned up around
her neck, hid her slim throat, while a heavy beard,
hastily affixed, concealed the outlines of her oval
face. With her nether limbs thrust into a pair of
workingman’s trousers, and her feet hidden in heavy
boots, she bore no resemblance to the fashionably
dressed woman for whom the police were watching
so eagerly.</p>

<p>Caruth, however, did not seem to mind her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
costume, even when her beard tickled his nose and
made him sneeze. Only muttering something about
insisting that she should shave as soon as she became
Mrs. C., he continued to kiss and hug her as though
he would never be satisfied.</p>

<p>“To think I’ve got you at last!” he cried. “After
all these days and days of doubt and anxiety. To
think that soon we’ll be on our own yacht, bound
for our own country, away from all this horrible
plotting and counterplotting. Oh, I can’t believe
it!”</p>

<p>The girl shuddered slightly. “I can’t either,”
she sighed. “I’m afraid—oh, I’m horribly afraid
that something will happen yet to prevent. I didn’t
use to be afraid of anything! I always thought that
I could face whatever came without quailing, but
now—now I’m a very woman, dear! Love has
made me timid. I don’t think I could bear it if I
were caught now.”</p>

<p>“Caught! You can’t be and shan’t be. Why,
we are half way to St. Petersburg already.”</p>

<p>“Not quite yet! And even if we were—oh, I’m
afraid. Lermantoff is not an alarmist. He never
speaks without good reason. No one else could
have persuaded me to wear this ridiculous disguise.”</p>

<p>Caruth grinned. “We’ll keep it as a memento of
our honeymoon,” he observed. “Don’t worry. A
good many wives don the trousers after marriage;
you are only anticipating a little. And I don’t think
you need be afraid. I can’t see a cloud on the——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>He broke off as a shadow fell across the compartment,
darkening the window, and a voice, rough
and strained, flung a brief sentence into the interior—a
sentence that made Marie spring up in terror.</p>

<p>A man was standing on the running board, hanging
to the casement. A glance at the cap he wore
told that he was one of the guards (or brakemen)
of the train. Volubly he sputtered in harsh-sounding
Russian and eagerly Marie drank in his words. Then
as suddenly as he had come, he was gone.</p>

<p>Marie sank back on the cushions, and Caruth
could see that she had grown deathly white.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t to be, dear love,” she gasped. “It
wasn’t to be.”</p>

<p>Caruth gazed at her in consternation. This
cowering woman was not the brave girl he remembered.
Love had indeed robbed her of her courage.</p>

<p>“What is it? What is it?” he importuned, sinking
down beside her. “Lermantoff shall not back
out now. He shall not take you away from me. If
he tries——”</p>

<p>“It isn’t Lermantoff. It’s the police. They know
I am here. They know my disguise. They know
I am on this train. They are only waiting till it
stops to seize me. The guard is one of our men.
He came along the footboard at the risk of his life
to warn me. It’s all over, dear. I’ll never see
America again.”</p>

<p>For an instant the girl sobbed on; then she buried
her hot face in her hands. “Oh!” she wailed, “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
cannot bear it! I had not realized it! Save me!
For God’s sake, save me!”</p>

<p>All his life Caruth had been noted for the speed
with which he came to decisions, and the rapidity
with which he acted upon them, and this, his most
exciting experience, furnished no exception to the
rule. Before the last words had fallen from the girl’s
lips, he was slipping out of his light spring overcoat.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?” he exclaimed.
“You cut it fine, Marie. Why”—with a fleeting
glance out the window—“we’re in the city now!”</p>

<p>They were, but fear, like love, has wings, and
before the train reached the station the girl had been
disguised afresh. Shorn of her beard, and clothed
in Caruth’s stylish overcoat, with his cap drawn down
over her ears, she made a very presentable boy.</p>

<p>Caruth looked her over critically. “You’ll do,”
he decided.</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope so! But aren’t you going to——”
She glanced at her discarded hat and coat.</p>

<p>“Neverlee.” The joy of the game was mounting
to Caruth’s head like wine. “Neverlee! That
would be ruin sure enough. I’ve got a scheme
worth two of that. You’ve got a pistol, haven’t
you? Let’s see it.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” The girl drew it out wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Good!” He sat down and leaned forward.
“Now,” he said, “hit me with the butt of your
revolver. Here.” He laid his finger on his forehead
just at the bottom of the hair. “Hit hard,” he concluded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
“and when the train gets into the station
put out for the American Embassy and stay there
till I come. Hit! Hit hard!”</p>

<p>The girl shrank back. “I can’t,” she breathed.</p>

<p>“You must. You’ve got to have time to escape
from the railway station, and this is the only thing
that would explain my delay and lend artistic verisimilitude
to a bald and unconvincing narrative, as
our friend, the <i>Mikado</i>, once said. Don’t be afraid;
my skull is thick, and won’t be seriously hurt.
Quick! We are getting into the station. Think
that I am General Somebodyoffski and hit—hit
hard. Quick!”</p>

<p>The girl’s eyes grew big with tears. “I did not
think there lived such a man as you,” she breathed.
“Now I understand why your great country is free.
Such men as you must be free. Oh, God! Is there
no other way?”</p>

<p>“None. The train is stopping. Quick!” Despairingly,
the girl glanced around. Then she lifted
the heavy revolver and struck as Caruth had directed.
Without a moan he sank back, unconscious, in his
seat.</p>

<p>For a moment Marie stood gazing at her handiwork.
Then a great sob shook her frame, and she
bent down and pressed her lips to the purpling
wound.</p>

<p>“Forgive, forgive!” she cried. “If it had been
life alone—— Oh, love, forgive, forgive!”</p>

<p>The next moment she was gone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT is one thing to embark on adventure and
another thing to carry it through. Though the
first step costs more than any other one step, it
does not cost more than the aggregate of the rest,
and certainly does not cost more than the period of
suspense that inevitably comes in any prolonged
enterprise. All of which serves as an introduction
to the statement that though Florence began well,
she soon sickened of her venture.</p>

<p>The conditions were against her. She had always
been used to a good share of the world’s comforts.
Even in New York, hanging on the ragged edge of
the bottomless pit, she had never been penniless,
and had never held back from anything she wanted
through fear of becoming penniless. Like a cat,
she loved warmth and the cream of life.</p>

<p>When she placed the red light in her port on the
<i>Sea Spume</i> and dropped over the side into the arms
in which Wilkins willingly received her, she contemplated
nothing more unpleasant than a sail by
night over the dancing waves to a safe port. The
danger that menaced her not being visible, she disregarded
it; or felt it only as giving a zest to a romantic
flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>But things did not turn out as she had anticipated.
They seldom do. Scarcely had the sloop gained the
open sea when it became apparent that it was too
heavily laden. The wind was only ordinarily fresh,
and the waves were not at all dangerous to an ordinary
craft; yet they broke continually over the rail.
Soon it was evident that to attempt to run across
the open channel to the Swedish coast would be
suicidal, and to run for Copenhagen even more so.
Much against his will, Wilkins was forced to keep
south around the lee of the islands, and finally to
run for a Russian port. Even on this tack, the trip
was very dangerous, and for more than three hours
Florence, who had never before done any work
harder than carrying a spear in the front rank of
the chorus, had to toil strenuously helping to pump
out the water that poured in unceasingly.</p>

<p>When a girl is cold and wet and exhausted beyond
expression for several hours, during all of which
Death sits grinning over her shoulder, it is not
exactly surprising if she wonders whether the game
is worth the candle.</p>

<p>Nor were matters greatly improved when at last
the sloop won to the port of Helsingfors and dropped
anchor along with other fishing-smacks in the bay,
where her passengers hoped to lie unnoticed while
Bill Wilkins, who alone spoke Russian, ran up to
St. Petersburg to try to find a steamer whose captain
would consent, for a sufficiently large remuneration,
to clear for a foreign port and then run out of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
course close to Helsingfors, to take the gold on board.
Such a captain once found, and signals arranged,
Bill would return to Helsingfors to join the others
and help take the schooner out to meet the vessel.</p>

<p>Tom Wilkins stood the monotony of waiting very
well. Used to the loneliness of the plains, his own
thoughts sufficed. But Florence had no resources
in herself. Accustomed to the clatter of New York,
she had been bored even by the quietness of the life
on the <i>Sea Spume</i>, and this was ten times worse.
Day after day she did nothing but twirl her fingers
and think about Baron Demidroff and his wonderful
tale of Princess Yves Napraxine.</p>

<p>Such was her mood on the third afternoon of her
imprisonment, when Wilkins, with a fatuity scarcely
credible, attempted to cheer her up by making love
to her. Florence promptly went into hysterics, and
Wilkins had the time of his life in quieting her.
That night, after pretending to go to bed, she slipped
away, rowing herself ashore in the only small boat
belonging to the sloop, and took the night train for
St. Petersburg. By the time that Wilkins missed
her she was at the office of Baron Demidroff.</p>

<p>Even when there, however, she found it none too
easy to reach the Baron. Totally ignorant of the
language, and unable to ask her way, she had to
trust to luck, and luck did not favor her. It was
late in the afternoon—the afternoon of the same
day and at about the same hour when Caruth and
Marie were leaving Gatchina—that she at last found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
her way to the Baron’s office and sent in a card
inscribed with Olga’s name, but with the additional
words, “Princess Yves Napraxine,” pencilled in the
corner.</p>

<p>But after that events moved fast. Scarcely had
her card vanished when the door was flung open
and the Baron rushed in, both hands extended.</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>Madame la Princesse</i>!” he exclaimed. “To
think of seeing you here! Come in! Come in!”
Eagerly he urged her toward the inner office, pouring
out the while a flood of welcomings. “Well! Well!”
he exclaimed. “To think of it. Where did you come
from, Princess? Where have you been all these
days?”</p>

<p>Florence seated herself and stared at him with
cool insolence. Instinctively she knew that she
would gain no more from him by softness than she
had gained in former days from the “Johnnies” in
New York. Men were all alike, she decided, and
the weeping, clinging girl was a back number.</p>

<p>“Back off! Back off!” she ordered. “I’m not
telling where I’ve been yet.”</p>

<p>“But the gold, Princess! The gold!”</p>

<p>“The gold is all to the downy. It’s where I can
put my hand on it. You see, Baron, I’m one of the
new woman push, and I ain’t trusting anybody.
You might play fair if I turned the stuff over to you,
and you might not. It’s me for the sure thing
every time. That’s why I got me suitors to carry
the gold off and hide it away till I got guarantees.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>Instead of showing vexation, the Baron chuckled.
Such impudence from one altogether in his power
was refreshing. Florence had made no mistake in
her treatment of him. The Baron admired any one
who was clever enough to see through him. Besides,
the girl was very handsome.</p>

<p>“What guarantees do you want, Princess?” he
asked soberly.</p>

<p>Florence hesitated; she did not know what to
ask. “I want to see the proofs,” she declared
vaguely. “You hand me a jolly about strawberry
mark and me lost ancestors and ask me to turn over
five million dollars in return. It ain’t good enough!
See? I’d rather keep the five million dollars meself,
if there’s any doubt about the thing.”</p>

<p>“Quite reasonable! Quite reasonable!” The
Baron nodded. “The proofs are largely documentary.
I will send for them. Meanwhile——”</p>

<p>The Baron paused for a moment; then went on.
“Princess!” he said, “I will be frank with you. I
see that you are not one to be deceived. To a fair
face you unite the cool head of a man——”</p>

<p>“Cut it out! Cut it out!”</p>

<p>“It is the truth. But you do not know Russia.
Here every man has his price. Every one is making
himself rich. What you call graft flourishes. You
are the Princess Yves Napraxine; that is true. You
are heiress to enormous wealth; that also is true.
But if you think that all you have to do is to come
forward and show who you are, in order to get that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
rank and wealth, you know little of Russia. Your
estates are in the hands of a trustee who has grown
rich in caring for them. Think you he will readily
give them up? Not so! He is a powerful man—one
who stands in a high place. Once he hears of you,
you will disappear, unless protected by a power as
strong or stronger than his—in fact, Princess, unless
protected by me.”</p>

<p>Florence nodded. The Baron’s words were really
a relief to her. It was quite believable that a man
who had had the control of twenty millions for ten
years would fight to retain that control, and that
they could easily dispose of a lone woman, irrespective
of the fact that she was really an impostor.
But if the Baron were ready to back and protect
her, as he seemed to imply, the situation would be
changed.</p>

<p>“You’re all to the good, Baron,” she agreed. “Go
on and tell me. I’m from Missouri, you know.”</p>

<p>“This trustee is my enemy, Princess,” went on
Demidroff. “For years he has been trying to ruin
me. In the effort, he has used the power of your
millions unscrupulously. A year ago I concluded
that I must wrest the control of those millions from
him, or he would destroy me. I set on foot inquiries
which led me to you. The nihilists thought they
had you brought to Russia. Well, so they did, but
it was I that pulled the strings. I brought you here
to wrest Count Strogoff’s wealth from him. By
my aid, you can win money and place; by your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
aid, I shall triumph over the Count. United, we
shall win everything; divided, we both lose. But
I must help you before you will be able to help
me. It is really I that should demand guarantees,
Princess.”</p>

<p>Florence did not answer for a moment. The
Baron’s words seemed reasonable enough, and she
felt somehow that he was telling her the truth. The
mist of intrigue, plot, and counterplot in the midst
of which she found herself, was exactly the sort of
thing she had always understood was characteristic
of Russia. To her dramatic instincts the whole thing
seemed logical and feasible, supposing her to be the
real Olga Shishkin. Well, she might as well go on
pretending. Obviously nothing was to be gained by
confession.</p>

<p>“And the <i>Orkney’s</i> gold?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“The <i>Orkney’s</i> gold? I want it! Yes, but only
to aid me to aid you. If I recover it, I win my imperial
master’s favor and I pave the way for your
recognition. On the other hand, failure will lose
me that confidence, and make it harder for me to
triumph over Count Strogoff and help you. Except
for this, the gold counts for comparatively little.
Your estates are worth five times as much.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“Now, Princess, I will make you a proposal. You
are a woman, clever, young, and beautiful, but weak;
I am a bachelor, not very young, but not yet very
old, and I am powerful, and power is what you need.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
<i>Madame la Princesse</i>, will you do me the honor to
become my wife?”</p>

<p>Florence’s breath was taken away with a vengeance.
That she, the variety actress of a month before,
should be receiving a proposal of marriage from
the chief of the Russian secret police was past belief.
“Gee!” she muttered. “What’s coming next? If
the pipe don’t go out and I don’t wake up, the first
thing I know the Czarski’ll be asking me to share
his bomb-proof cottage with him.”</p>

<p>Scarcely she heard the Baron’s following words:</p>

<p>“I know that it is presumption for me to address
you, Princess,” he was saying. “My family, though
noble, is by no means on a par with yours. Still, I
assure you that your union with me cannot be termed
a <i>mesalliance</i>. The position I have won makes it
possible for me to mate with any one outside of the
blood royal. Will you not accept me, Princess?”</p>

<p>The daze was passing away, and Florence was
regaining command of herself. “Gee!” she muttered
desperately. “Gee! He’s a nice old fellow, any way,
and I don’t know but what—oh, gee!” she exploded.
“I’m afraid! I’m afraid!” She looked up at the
Baron. “I must think! I must think!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Assuredly, Princess! Think all you like. And
remember that, though I do not talk of sentiment,
for you might think me deceitful, yet I feel it, Princess.
I am not so old that I cannot admire and love—yes,
love, Princess. But I will leave that till
later. Just now remember that I can give you everything,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
and that I offer myself as a guarantee of my
truth. Can I say more?”</p>

<p>“No! No!” Florence had found her tongue at
last. “No! No! You can’t say more. And I will
accept if I can. I will, honest. But I must think.
I must talk to my friends on the <i>Sea Spume</i>.”</p>

<p>“Certainly! Yet do not forget that time flies.
Will the gold stay safe while you think?”</p>

<p>Florence paled. “Gracious!” she cried. “I forgot
the gold!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I can save you the necessity of going
on board the yacht.” Demidroff touched a bell.
“I will send for some one whom you will be glad
to see,” he explained.</p>

<p>“Who is it?”</p>

<p>“You shall see.” Demidroff touched a bell and
gave an order in Russian. An instant later the door
was pushed open.</p>

<p>Professor Shishkin stood on the threshold!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NEITHER Florence nor the Professor was as
much surprised at seeing the other as might
have been expected, and this for the very
simple reason that neither knew that the other had
been missing. Ever since her flight, Florence had
been cut off from all information concerning the
yacht, while Professor Shishkin had vanished during
the fight without having learned of the treachery
of Wilkins and the woman who was impersonating
his daughter.</p>

<p>Consequently, when they saw each other, neither
expressed any particular amazement nor delight.
Each, indeed, was uncertain what this confrontation
in the office of the chief of the secret police could
mean. Shishkin wondered if Florence had betrayed
his substitution of her for his daughter, while Florence
wondered whether the Professor was about
to bring her to shame by disclosing that very fact.
Each, therefore, stared at the other much as do
two strange dogs hesitating whether to fight or to
fraternize.</p>

<p>At last the Professor stretched out a trembling
hand. “Olga! My child!” he quavered.</p>

<p>Florence was not dull. If Shishkin still called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
her child, he had not betrayed her; possibly he might
not intend to do so. “Father!” she cried, with a
histrionic gesture that smacked of music hall days.
“Father! But no! You are not me father! Oh,
father, how could you tear me from me happy
home?”</p>

<p>The Professor looked stunned, as well he might.
If Florence had had a happy home when he took
her from the music hall, he had never heard of it.</p>

<p>Florence, however, gave him no time to explain.
“Oh, father!” she cried again. “When you stole
me from the home of the Grand Duke Ivan, my real
father, did you never think how you wr’r’ronged
me?”</p>

<p>The Professor started. The mention of the Grand
Duke showed him that Florence’s words had no
such superficial meaning as he had at first supposed.
With satisfaction, he remembered that the true Olga
was far away in America. Whatever this girl was
driving at, could not alter that fact. He glanced at
Demidroff, who sat watching, and grew cautious.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> stole you—I?” he protested. “What do you
mean?”</p>

<p>Florence breathed easier. The old man had caught
her cue and was playing up to her. “All is discovered!”
she cried theatrically. “Twenty years ago,
here, in Russia, you stole me from my father, the
Grand Duke Ivan, and took me to America, away
from all I knew and loved. How could you do it?
How could you do it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>Shishkin began to understand. It was not only
the nihilists who knew that he had stolen Olga;
Demidroff knew it, too! This girl knew it! But
what was this talk of grand ducal paternity?</p>

<p>“It was my right,” he protested. “It is always
a man’s right to recover his own child.”</p>

<p>“But I am not your child. Did you think that
I was your child when you stole me? That explains,
Baron! That explains! He thought it was his own
child he was taking. And he has been very good
to me. I will not have him hurt or punished. You
must let him go. You will do that much for me?”</p>

<p>Demidroff nodded. “I will do much for you,
Princess,” he murmured; “perhaps even that.”</p>

<p>“Professor”—he turned to the old man—“I
was not in office when the Princess Yves Napraxine
was stolen, and am not very familiar with the circumstances;
but I know it did not occur to any one
at the time that she had been taken in mistake for
your daughter. It was only a few months ago,
when I began to look into the case, that I suspected
something of the sort. Your words confirm my
belief. Professor, you did not steal your own daughter.
You stole the daughter of the Grand Duke
Ivan, the Princess Yves Napraxine, who was the
same age, and was playing with her. You brought
her up as your own. And now you have brought
her back to resume her rightful place in the world
as heiress to a great fortune and a great name.”</p>

<p>Professor Shishkin tottered to a chair and sank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
down. Not for a moment did he doubt the truth
of Demidroff’s words. Again and again he had
tried to find in Olga a resemblance to himself or to
his dead wife, but always in vain. The girl was like
neither of them—in face or in character. Often he
had wondered whence she had gotten this or that
trait, and now he understood. The fabric of his
life fell shattered round him.</p>

<p>What was to be done? He loved Olga, even if
she were not his own daughter; for twenty years he
had cared for her; he had dared nihilist vengeance
rather than let her come to Russia and run the risk
of being separated from him. He could not give her
up now.</p>

<p>And would she want to be given up? She was
married and supposedly three thousand miles away,
presumably happy and content, knowing nothing
of all this. Would she care to leave it all for a new
life, even if it brought her wealth and station? He
doubted it. For the present, at any rate, he would
tell nothing.</p>

<p>He raised his head and looked at Demidroff. “Is
this true?” he demanded.</p>

<p>The Baron nodded. “Perfectly true!” he replied.
“From all accounts, the disappearance of the princess
was discovered almost immediately. It was supposed
that she had been stolen by some enemy of the Grand
Duke. Strenuous efforts were made to find her,
but they all failed. There were no clues. No one
guessed that Count Lladislas had escaped from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul and come back to
carry away his own child. Until I took the matter
up, a few weeks ago, no one knew whether she was
alive or dead. Now the proofs are nearly completed;
it needs only your own affidavit that you stole this
lady from the ducal palace, to render them irrefutable.”</p>

<p>“But—but——” the Professor gasped—“but my
own child. Where is she?”</p>

<p>“She is safe and well. I will tell you about her
in good time. First, however, comes that affidavit.
Will you draw it up now?”</p>

<p>Professor Shishkin faltered. The question with
him, however, was one of sentiment and not one of
morality. If need be, he was willing to make a
hundred affidavits, careless of their truth, counting
it a virtue to deceive any one connected with the
Czar and his government. The memory of the
wrongs they had wrought on him still burned in
his mind. Not in all the years that had elapsed
had he forgotten them. But he had begun to remember
Olga’s rights. No matter whose daughter she
might be, no matter what rightful enmity he bore
against her father, she herself was dear to him. Now
that it came to the point, he could not bring himself
to throw away her rights without consulting her;
certainly not without serious consideration. He
would give no affidavit at the moment.</p>

<p>Yet if he refused, Demidroff would keep him in
suspense about his own daughter. Well, he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
bear it; he had been separated from her for twenty
years; surely he could wait a little longer.</p>

<p>But what excuse to give? What plea could he
offer for refusing to bear witness to a state of affairs
which he had already admitted?</p>

<p>While still he hesitated, Demidroff, who had been
watching him with rising suspicion of he knew not
what, struck in. “I believe I am justified, Professor,”
he remarked suavely, “in telling you that your
daughter is suspected of affiliation with the terrorists,
and is now being sought by the authorities. Information
has recently reached me that she is in hiding
in a near-by town and is liable to be arrested any
moment. The charges against her are not very
serious, however, and I shall be glad to quash them
if I have reason to believe that you are friendly to
me. This is only by the way, however. The pressing
business in hand is that affidavit.”</p>

<p>The old man flushed red, then white; he had
opened his lips to speak, to defy this man who was
mocking him, when Florence burst in.</p>

<p>The show-girl had been watching the old man
narrowly, and had guessed very accurately what
was passing in his mind. She felt that it was high
time for her to speak.</p>

<p>“Father,” she exclaimed anxiously—“for I will
still call you father! Do not forget your obligations
to <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>The old man started. He had entirely forgotten
Florence. Obviously she hoped that he would let<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
the deception go on; obviously she had fostered it,
even if she had not been responsible for it; plainly
she was a little cheat, who ought to be exposed.
Yet, after all, he himself was partly responsible for
her deceit; he had palmed her off as Olga, and even
if she had gone beyond his instructions, he felt it
his duty to see that no harm should come to her.
Indeed, he had promised her as much in New York.
Slowly he raised his tremulous eyes. “I will not
forget,” he promised.</p>

<p>Florence drew a long breath. She resolved to
dare everything. “Say!” she exclaimed. “I’ll
put it to you straight. When popper died—the
Grand Duke Ivan, I mean—when popper died he
left a lot of money that was to come to me if I ever
turned up. He left it in the hands of Count Strogoff
as trustee. Now, what the Count’s done to it is a
plenty. He thinks it’s his, and he won’t give it up
till he’s made to. He ain’t a quitter. He’ll fight
for all he’s worth, and I ain’t going to have any
walkover for the stakes. Not on your tin-type. But
the Baron here believes in me. He says he and I can
win out if we do good team work. He wants to marry
me and make a play for the money. Nobody else
could win. If I was married already, for instance,”—Florence
spoke slowly and pointedly—“my name
would be Dennis, for the Baron holds all the cards
and wouldn’t back the game unless he stood to pull
down something worth while. You see that, don’t
you? Now, if you’ll just give the Baron that affidavit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
we’ll tour round to the Embassy and get a sure
’nuf preacher. I’ll marry the Baron again any way
he says later on, but I’ve got to be married by somebody
I know something about first. I ain’t taking
any chances on an illustrated post-card priest. Now,
father, what do you say?”</p>

<p>The Professor had listened intently. The girl’s
words carried conviction. He had heard of Count
Strogoff, and could guess how that personage would
fight to retain possession of a fortune he had once
gotten his hands on. Decidedly, the game was not
worth the candle, so far as the real Olga was concerned.
It was her happiness that he wished for,
not to unsettle her life, so happily begun, by dangling
before her a dream of wealth that, however it ended,
could not bring her greater contentment than was
hers at present. If Florence wanted to take the
risks of the game, let her. He owed nothing to Demidroff
nor to any other Russian.</p>

<p>“Very well,” he declared, turning to the Baron.
“I’ll sign the affidavit just as soon as this young
lady is safely married to you at the American Embassy—on
the distinct pledge, however, that you
tell me who my daughter is and give her a chance to
escape with me out of Russia.”</p>

<p>The Baron nodded. “Agreed!” he exclaimed.
“It is, of course, understood that you make no complaint
about the Burndo matter. Yes? Very well.”</p>

<p>He struck a bell, and a man entered, bringing a
note which the Baron read. “Let him wait,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
ordered, in Russian. He turned back to the old
man. “If you will go with this messenger, Professor,”
he said, “he will enable you to arrange your
toilet.”</p>

<p>The Professor bowed and followed the man; and
the Baron turned to Florence.</p>

<p>“You do me honor, Princess,” he said, bowing.
“It shall be my task to see that you do not regret it.
You, too, will want to arrange yourself. But before
you go, tell me where that gold is.”</p>

<p>Florence told him. The die was cast now, and
no holding back was possible. “But, say,” she
concluded, almost wistfully, “you won’t hurt those
Wilkinses, will you? They’re right nice boys, and
while, of course, I ain’t treating them any worse
than they treated Mr. Caruth, still, I’d hate to have
their deaths on my conscience.”</p>

<p>The Baron laughed happily and pinched Florence’s
cheek. “Oh ho!” he cried. “I am to spare everybody,
am I?—even the Wilkinses? You are too
tender hearted for Russia, Princess! But I’ll do it
this time. I’ll spare them if they’ll let me. Now,
Princess, au revoir. As soon as you are ready, we
will start for the Embassy.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">CONSCIOUSNESS struggled back to Caruth
slowly, but it came at last. All about him
was the roar of a great passenger station, the
murmur of voices, the tramp of feet, the banging
of carriage doors, the thump of baggage. Dully he
put his hand to his head and felt a tremendous
swelling just above his forehead. Then he looked
around at the unfamiliar foreign faces that ringed
him about. Somebody was questioning him in harsh
spitting Russian.</p>

<p>He did not understand, and shook his head petulantly,
only to cease quickly on account of the pain
which the movement caused him. Memory had
returned with a jerk, and he wondered whether
Marie had escaped. He must give her as much time
as he could to pass the gates. He closed his eyes
and lay silent.</p>

<p>Five minutes sped by. Then he was picked up,
bundled into a cab, and driven away. He gathered
that he was under arrest, but he was not troubled.
His story was unassailable. Besides, his head ached
too much for him to think of anything else.</p>

<p>On the way to headquarters his head became
better, and on his arrival he was able to talk quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
clearly and connectedly to a courteous individual
who spoke English very well. Caruth did not know
it, but it was Baron Demidroff himself who questioned
him.</p>

<p>“I especially regret that this should have happened
to you, Mr. Caruth,” he said apologetically. “You
must already have a very poor opinion of Russia,
I fear, after your unfortunate experience in the <i>Sea
Spume</i>.”</p>

<p>A qualm came to Caruth as he realized that he
was known, but it quickly passed. After all, the
knowledge merely anticipated the story he was about
to tell.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “Such things happen
everywhere, Monsieur,” he replied. “Don’t trouble
about it.”</p>

<p>The Baron smiled. “Certain inquiries must be
made,” he answered. “Can you give me a description
of the person who robbed you?”</p>

<p>The young man hesitated. Lying did not come
easily to him.</p>

<p>“Not very well,” he said reluctantly. “I had no
reason for noticing him. Generally speaking, he
was tall and broad and had a thick beard.”</p>

<p>“We found the beard in the railway carriage.
He carried off your overcoat and hat, you say?”</p>

<p>“Probably.”</p>

<p>“Then he could not have been very stout. You
are too slender for your clothing to fit a very large
man. Is it not so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>Caruth put his hand painfully to his head. “I
guess I’d have thought of that myself if my head had
been clear,” he evaded. “A crack like that isn’t
conducive to lucidity.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I suppose you have no reason to suppose
that this brawny man was really a woman?”</p>

<p>Caruth’s heart contracted painfully. “A woman!”
he exclaimed. “Heavens, no! No woman could
strike a blow like that!”</p>

<p>“No? You are sure, then, that it could not have
been struck by one Marie Fitzhugh, so called, who
made the voyage from America to Russia on your
yacht?”</p>

<p>Caruth struggled to his feet with what assumption
of dignity he could command. “You are pleased
to jest, Monsieur,” he remarked stiffly. “Miss
Fitzhugh is a valued friend. To think of her in
such a connection as this is little short of an insult.
I will bid you good day, Monsieur.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast. When do you leave Russia, Mr.
Caruth?”</p>

<p>The young man looked the elder in the eye.
“To-night, I hope,” he answered shortly.</p>

<p>“So? That is good. I was about to advise an
early departure. Russia does not seem to agree with
you, Mr. Caruth. You are too unfortunate. I fear—I
very much fear—that a third misfortune more
serious than the others will overtake you if you stay
much longer. But if you are leaving soon——”</p>

<p>“I hope to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>“Very well. I trust nothing will prevent. <i>Bon
voyage</i>, Mr. Caruth.”</p>

<p>Heavy heartedly the young American drove to a
hotel and sent for a physician, who dressed his
head, prescribed a sedative, and ordered him to bed.
Caruth bowed him out, poured the sedative into
the slop basin, and set off for the American Embassy.
He did not feel at all certain of his reception. The
ambassador was absent on leave and the <i>Chargé
d’Affaires</i>, who acted in his place, had long before
been rendered nearly frantic by the complications
of the <i>Sea Spume’s</i> case. What he would say when
this fresh development was forced upon him, Caruth
found it difficult to guess.</p>

<p>If Marie had arrived there in disguise, as he hoped
she had, he could imagine that the poor <i>Chargé</i> was
having a bad quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>His anticipations proved true. As he entered the
office the <i>Chargé</i> sprang up. “Well, Mr. Caruth,”
he cried, “this is the limit! Not content with engaging
in filibustering, you seem to have gone in
for direct nihilism. Heavens, man, haven’t you any
consideration for the position you put me in?”</p>

<p>Caruth did not answer. His eyes had lighted on
a well-remembered form, and he turned to greet
Marie Fitzhugh.</p>

<p>Swiftly she came toward him still dressed in her
men’s clothes, and laid her white hand in his.</p>

<p>“Thank God you are safe!” she said with a catch
in her voice. “It was the bravest thing I ever knew.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>Caruth smiled at her. “Nonsense!” he answered.
“I’ve taken many a harder crack in football. It was
all right again in ten minutes. And the police
couldn’t do a thing to me, though I guess they knew
pretty well what had happened. But you? Did you
get through all right?”</p>

<p>“Easily. I came here, and—well, I suppose I
made myself a nuisance, and——” She turned
shyly toward the <i>Chargé</i>.</p>

<p>But that gentleman had calmed down a little. He
had remembered that Caruth’s friends were powerful
politically and that it might not be well for him
to show too much irritation.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” he protested. “Not at all. I simply
didn’t know what to do under the circumstances.
And I’d really be glad if you’d tell me just what you
want me to do now.”</p>

<p>Caruth smiled. “There’s one thing you can do
all right, all right,” he answered happily, “and
it won’t compromise you, either. Just call in
your Embassy minister and let him marry us as
quick as he can say the words. Then if we can
get to the <i>Sea Spume</i>, we’ll skiddoo and leave
you alone forevermore. That’ll be a relief, I
know.”</p>

<p>The <i>Chargé’s</i> face cleared. “Delighted,” he
answered, somewhat ambiguously. “I’ll send for
the minister at once. He lives just around the corner.
Meanwhile, hadn’t you better—er—send out for
some clothes for Miss Fitzhugh? Mr. Forbes is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
very high church, and I’m not sure that he would
consent to marry her under——”</p>

<p>But Caruth interrupted. “Sure!” he laughed.
“I had forgotten. If you’ll let me get at the ’phone,
I’ll ask Mrs. Bristow to get what is needed and hurry
it around. Besides, I’d like to have the Bristows
here. It will seem more like home.”</p>

<p>The <i>Chargé</i> rose. “The telephone is in the next
room,” he said. “The messenger will show you.
Is there anything else I can do?” The thought of
getting rid of the <i>Sea Spume</i> affair made him
positively affable.</p>

<p>“Nothing, thank you.”</p>

<p>As the two went out, a card was brought to the
<i>Chargé</i>. He scanned it and his face grew grave.
For a moment he hesitated; then, “Ask Baron
Demidroff to come in,” he directed.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BARON DEMIDROFF entered the office of the
Embassy jauntily. Things were coming his
way. He had found the Princess and gotten
her on his side, and he would soon recover the
<i>Orkney’s</i> gold. With such a potent recommendation,
he could reëstablish himself in favor, wrest the control
of the Princess’s fortune from Count Strogoff,
and put that gentleman where he could do no more
harm. There was not a cloud on his horizon.</p>

<p>But there were a good many on that of the <i>Chargé</i>.
Ignorant of the true reason of the Baron’s errand
he could put but one construction on it: the Baron
was coming in person to demand the surrender of
Caruth’s bride. He foresaw various unpleasantnesses
before the matter was settled.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he rose to greet the Baron warmly.
He knew him very well indeed, having, in fact,
taught him to play poker at the club only the night
before.</p>

<p>On this intimacy he based almost his sole hope
of a satisfactory outcome to the affair. Those
people who assert that the functions of an ambassador
have been superseded by the cable and the long-distance
telephone, and argue that those highly ornate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
offices should be abolished forthwith, fail to take
into account the mellowing effects of personal intercourse.
Men who have met daily on friendly terms
can usually smooth over causes of irritation as they
arise and prevent them from developing into crises,
and can often even suppress a crisis itself after it
has developed—unless, of course, one or the other
country is determined to quarrel. The <i>Chargé</i>
believed that the Baron would not quarrel with him
unless it could not be avoided.</p>

<p>So he sprang to his feet. “Ah, Baron! Glad to
see you,” he cried. “Sit down. What can I do for
you?” He glanced expectantly at the tall old gentleman
and the handsome girl who stood waiting close
behind.</p>

<p>The Baron chuckled. “Much, my dear fellow,
much,” he cried. “But first let me present my
friends. This is Professor Shishkin, so called, for
whom you have been inquiring so anxiously for
several days. I believe you have not met!”</p>

<p>The <i>Chargé</i> grasped the Professor’s hand.
“What!” he cried. “Really! Why, Professor, you
don’t know how glad I am to see you. We’ve been——”</p>

<p>“And this,” the Baron interrupted; “this is the
lady who for twenty years has been known as Miss
Olga Shishkin, and who has passed as daughter of
Professor Shishkin.”</p>

<p>The <i>Chargé</i> bowed. Officially, he had heard of
Florence’s flight only as a disappearance, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
supposed to know nothing of the peculiar circumstances
attending it. Actually, he knew a good deal
more than had appeared on the surface, and the
conjunction of his three visitors staggered him.
And what was this talk about a “supposed” daughter?</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see you,” he muttered half-heartedly.
“How did you——”</p>

<p>Again the Baron broke in. “Professor Shishkin,”
he announced, “will tell you that he was knocked
overboard during the outrageous attack by robbers
on the <i>Sea Spume</i>! He was held prisoner for several
days and was finally rescued by my men and brought
here. Miss Shishkin, so-called——”</p>

<p>The door opened and Bristow bounced in, with
Olga at his heels.</p>

<p>“We came right over,” he began, “the moment
we——”</p>

<p>He stopped, with distended eyes. It takes something
to surprise a veteran newspaper man, but the
presence of Demidroff, Shishkin, and Florence
together in that place did it.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” he boggled. “I thought
you were alone. I’ll——”</p>

<p>But Olga had seen the Professor, and her one
thought was to get at him. With shining eyes, she
thrust by her husband and rushed forward, hands
outstretched.</p>

<p>As she passed, Bristow realized the situation.</p>

<p>“Olga!” he cried sharply. “Olga!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>The tones reached the girl’s inner consciousness
and she stopped, hesitating.</p>

<p>Before she could recover, Bristow passed her
and grasped the Professor’s hand. “I’m delighted
to see you safe again, Professor,” he declared.
“Mrs. Bristow and I had about given you up. She
felt very strongly about your fate.... Olga! Shake
hands with Professor Shishkin.”</p>

<p>The Professor had managed to keep his self-possession.
Though Olga’s presence was a surprise
she was not to him as one returned from the dead,
as he was to her. Mingled with his surprise was a
feeling of enormous relief. Olga seemed to have
appeared in direct answer to his prayers, to enable
him to submit to her the question of her future. The
need for caution still remained, however, and controlled
him.</p>

<p>Quietly he and Olga pressed each other’s hands,
putting off to the future the more intimate welcoming
that would come. Bristow drew a long breath of
relief as he saw them. It did not occur to him to
look at Florence; in fact, for the moment he had
forgotten her.</p>

<p>Demidroff relieved the situation. So sure of the
facts and so full of his approaching triumph was he,
that he was less observant than usual and saw nothing
suspicious in the greeting. Nor did it occur to him
to look at Florence, not dreaming that the meeting
of the Professor and Mrs. Bristow could be of
interest to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>Eagerly he pressed on with his program. “I’m
glad to see you, Mr. Bristow,” he proclaimed. “You
are the man above all others I would have hoped
for. Through the Consolidated Press, you can lay
before the world the amazing tale I have to tell.”</p>

<p>The reporter pricked up his ears. If Demidroff
characterized a tale as amazing, it was worth listening
to.</p>

<p>“Twenty years ago,” went on the Baron, “Count
Lladislas Metrovitch, a Pole and a professor in the
University here, was arrested for participation in a
plot against the Czar. Whether he was guilty or not
does not matter now. He was convicted and was
imprisoned in a fortress. After three years it was
reported that he was dead. The truth was that he
had escaped.</p>

<p>“His first act was to look for his family. He
learned that his wife had died shortly after his arrest,
and that his daughter was being cared for by the
Grand Duke Ivan, who had known him and his
wife. By some means, he got into the Grand Duke’s
palace. He saw there a child about four years old,
which was the age of his own child, and from various
circumstances concluded that she was his own child.
He was deceived; she was not his own. She was the
little Princess Yves Napraxine, daughter of the
Grand Duke. But, unknowing, he stole her and
escaped to America, where he took the name of
Shishkin.”</p>

<p>The Baron paused and glanced around to note<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
the effect of his story. He need not have feared;
his listeners, one and all, were hanging breathlessly
on his words. The thoughts of each differed from
those of the rest, but there was not one to whom the
recital did not come sharply home. Bristow and
Olga, especially, were beginning to realize what this
might mean. No one had yet thought of Florence.</p>

<p>“The Grand Duke,” went on the Baron, “died
ten years ago. He left enormous wealth and no
children except the missing princess. He had always
refused to believe her dead, and in his will he left
all his fortune to her and provided for keeping up
the search for her. If she was not found in twenty
years, the estates were to escheat to the crown.</p>

<p>“Count Strogoff was made trustee of these estates,
and as time passed on, and the princess did not
appear, he doubtless came to look upon them as his
own. Undoubtedly he will demand the best of
proof before giving them up. But slowly and surely
I have traced the matter and riveted the proofs
one by one until they are indisputable.</p>

<p>“I was about to send for Professor Shishkin—Count
Lladislas—when he suddenly started for
Russia on the <i>Sea Spume</i>, bringing with him this
lady whom he supposed to be his daughter, but
who was really the Princess Yves Napraxine.”</p>

<p>As the Baron spoke, he drew Florence forward.
“I have the honor,” he declared, “to present to you
the Princess Yves Napraxine.”</p>

<p>Florence faced them boldly. Her face was white.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
The desperation of a cornered rat shone in her eyes.
Her swelling heart seemed about to suffocate her.
Yet she faced them all, head high; she would take
her medicine bravely when the time came; at least,
they should not call her coward.</p>

<p>Olga, too, was pale. The revelation of her birth
stunned her; the complications terrified her; the
loss at one blow of him whom she had always called
father and the substitution of fresh kindred and
fresh life made her brain reel. Desperately she
strove to reduce the confusion to order.</p>

<p>The Baron gave her time. “The Princess Yves
Napraxine,” he went on suavely, “has done me the
honor to consent to become my wife. I come now
to ask my good friend the <i>Chargé</i> to permit the
ceremony to be performed at his Embassy by the
American clergyman. Immediately afterwards we
will be remarried by the full rites of the Greek
Church.”</p>

<p>The <i>Chargé</i> said something courteous, but no
one except the Baron heard him. The rest were
listening to Olga and the Professor.</p>

<p>The former had found her tongue at last. Gently
she laid her hand on the old man’s sleeve. “Is this
true?” she questioned softly.</p>

<p>Long the Professor gazed into her eyes, and what
he read there gave him courage.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered slowly; “I believe it is true.
Certainly it is true that I stole the child, thinking
her my own daughter. I took her to America,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
brought her up as my own, loved her, cared for her.
And she was a good daughter to me, tender, sweet,
affectionate. If I wronged her by taking her from
her rightful station in life, I did it unknowingly.
But I am not so sure that I did wrong her. To be a
Russian princess is a great thing, but to be an
American girl and become the wife of a good, true
American is also a great thing. I am not certain
that the exchange was not a good thing for her as
well as for me. And still more do I doubt whether
the change back now will be good for her. Count
Strogoff is powerful and unscrupulous; he will fight
to retain control of the Napraxine millions. Only
the most powerful support can win against him;
only one like Baron Demidroff can venture to throw
down the gage to such a one as he. I cannot advise;
the Princess is twenty-three years old; she must
choose for herself. But before she does choose, it
might be well for her to advise with you. You, too,
are an American girl! You can tell her what you
would do in her place!”</p>

<p>The old man’s voice dropped. He had said all
there was to be said. For good or for ill, the matter
now lay in Olga’s hands. Almost calmly he waited
for her to choose.</p>

<p>The atmosphere had grown suddenly tense. Even
the Baron and the <i>Chargé</i>, ignorant of the facts as
they were, found themselves hanging on Olga’s lips,
while to Bristow and Florence the suspense was
terrible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>For a moment Olga hesitated. Then she laughed
lightly. “Good gracious!” she exclaimed, in a voice
that somehow instantly relaxed the tension. “Good
gracious! How can I tell? I’m not in the Princess’s
place. I’m married! If I wasn’t—well, I don’t
know. But”—she put out her hand and clasped
that of her husband—“but as things are, I wouldn’t
risk losing Joe for all the estates in Russia. I
wouldn’t give up America for the finest position that
Russia could offer. Certainly I wouldn’t trade my
happiness for a lawsuit. Joe tells me that I am an
American queen now; why should I care to become a
Russian princess. Oh, no! It wouldn’t suit me at
all. But——” she faced Florence with serenity in her
eyes—“but that hasn’t anything to do with you,
Princess. If you want to go ahead, we will all do
everything we can to make success easy for you.
I am sure that you need never fear that any of
us will obstruct you in any way. In fact, I, for
one, shall always be eternally grateful to you—for
permitting me the honor of your acquaintance, of
course.”</p>

<p>Florence’s hard eyes grew soft. “Anything I
can do for you—” she began.</p>

<p>But Olga had turned away. Grateful to Florence
she might be, but she did not care to fraternize with
her, certainly not until her disappearance from the
yacht had been explained. Besides, she wanted
to talk with Bristow, never so dear to her as at that
moment of abnegation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>Ringing with happiness, the Professor’s voice
struck in. Everything was coming out as he wanted
it.</p>

<p>“Where is that affidavit, Baron?” he questioned.
“I’ll sign it now with pleasure, and the <i>Chargé</i> here
will witness it.”</p>

<p>Slowly Demidroff drew out the paper. The scene
that had just passed puzzled him. He was not dull,
or he would never have climbed to his post in the
Russian service, and a suspicion that all was not as
he had supposed began to stir in his brain. He did
not guess the truth—how could he?—but probably
a glimmer of something not far from the truth
quivered before his eyes. He shot a keen glance
at Florence, who bore it without visible emotion;
then, as one who had resolved to go on at all hazards,
he handed the affidavit to the Professor and saw it
signed and witnessed.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “my dear <i>Chargé</i>, will you send
for your minister?”</p>

<p>The <i>Chargé</i> tugged at his mustache. He had
been rather crowded into the background for the
past few moments and was glad to get into the limelight
again. Besides, he judged that the psychical
moment had come to do what he could for Caruth.</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear Baron,” he rejoined, fingering
a note that an attendant had brought him a
moment before. “Certainly. He is in the next
room. I sent for him a few moments before your
arrival, although, of course, I had no idea that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
would require his services. In fact, I thought you
came on a very different matter.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” The Baron was polite, but was plainly
impatient. The <i>Chargé’s</i> ideas were of little moment
to him.</p>

<p>“Yes! The fact is I thought you came to demand
the surrender of a certain young lady whom you
might have some reason to suppose to be here—a
Russian lady known as Marie Fitzhugh.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! What of her? I understand that she
is here.” The Baron knew, of course, that Marie
was in the Embassy; and the <i>Chargé</i> knew that he
knew it or would soon know it. Anything else was
impossible.</p>

<p>“No such person is in the Embassy,” explained
the <i>Chargé</i> courteously. “In fact, there is no
Russian young lady here at all. However, I should
like to present you to an American young lady who
has been here for a few moments only.”</p>

<p>The Baron looked puzzled. “I shall be charmed
to meet any friend of your excellency’s,” he nodded.</p>

<p>The <i>Chargé</i> stepped to the inner door of the room.
“Will you young people please come in here,” he
called.</p>

<p>Side by side Caruth and Marie entered, followed
by Reverend Mr. Forbes, the American clergyman.
Caruth’s head was bound up, but his eyes were
bright.</p>

<p>“Baron,” said the <i>Chargé</i>. “Let me present to
you Mr. and Mrs. Caruth, just married by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
Reverend Mr. Forbes, who will shortly officiate at
your own wedding. A foreign-born wife, as you of
course know, takes the status of her husband and
becomes a citizen of his country. Mr. and Mrs.
Caruth are about to sail for America on the <i>Sea
Spume</i>, leaving Russia forever. I give you my
personal assurance of this. Would you mind viséing
their passports, and thus guaranteeing them safe
conduct out of Russia?”</p>

<p>The Baron swallowed once or twice. Then he
smiled.</p>

<p>“We Russians are not all quite so black as we are
painted,” he said. “I shall be happy to endorse their
passports.” He paused for a moment. “I regret
to add,” he finished, “that the visé will be good for
twenty-four hours only.”</p>

<p>He turned to the Professor, who was plucking
him by the sleeve.</p>

<p>“I have not forgotten, Professor,” he smiled.
“You want your daughter. Your <i>own</i> daughter,
I mean, of course. There she stands,” and he
pointed to Mrs. Caruth.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IF Florence had delayed her flight from Helsingfors
a day longer, she would probably not have
gone at all. At practically the same moment at
which she arrived at St. Petersburg, Bill Wilkins
left that city, having completed arrangements for
the shipment of the gold.</p>

<p>He had found the task of finding a ship a difficult
one. Ten tons of gold was not freight that would
ordinarily be found in the possession of a man of
Wilkins’s appearance, and the fact that he wanted to
get it out of the country secretly was abundant proof
that he had come by it illegally. To explain the true
nature of the stuff he wanted to ship, was to risk
arrest by the police on the one hand, and robbery
and murder by those who aided him on the other.</p>

<p>Yet it was practically impossible to conceal the
fact that it was gold with which he wished to escape.
Its mere weight would almost inevitably betray its
character, for it was not credible that he should be
willing to pay the sum necessary to induce a captain
to violate the laws and risk his ship in order to carry
off a few tons of lead, which was about the only
conceivable substance of approximately equal weight.</p>

<p>Gold, of course, might be so packed in boxes too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
large for it, as to conceal its relative weight, but the
Wilkins brothers had no means at hand to enable
them to do this.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it was not surprising
that it took Wilkins practically all of the ten days
he had supposed might be required to make his
arrangements. He made them at last, however,
with a villainous-looking captain, who drove a very
hard bargain, and whom Wilkins suspected would
turn robber if given the ghost of an opportunity.
Neither he nor Tom, however, shrank from taking
risks.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tom Wilkins had discovered Florence’s
disappearance but had found himself helpless.
Florence had taken the sloop’s only small boat, and
Wilkins, unable to swim, found himself hopelessly
marooned, unable to get ashore except by calling
for aid. Although he had no nerves to speak of,
and was ready at any time to fight his weight
in wild-cats, even he found the situation appalling.
Alone in a strange seaport, unable to speak a word of
the language, under ban of the police, tied by the
leg to a pile of gold, and deserted by his companions,
a weaker man would have attempted to sail away
despite his ignorance in regard to the management
of the boat. But Tom Wilkins was not that sort.
He would stick till the last minute.</p>

<p>Florence’s desertion was the hardest to bear. He
really loved the girl, and he had almost persuaded
himself that she loved him; believing this, he found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
it very hard to conclude that her absence spelled
treachery, as it obviously seemed to do. Rather,
knowing how she chafed against the long confinement
and remembering her hysterical fit of the night
before, he clung to the hope that she had merely
gone ashore and would soon be back.</p>

<p>But as the hours wore on and she did not return,
he was forced to believe that she had deserted and
perhaps betrayed him. He had taken her as a partner
in his flight when he had expected to reach safety
easily and quickly. If he had had any idea of what
was before him, he would have gone without her and
sent for her after the toil and danger of the adventure
was over. But, having taken her, he expected her
to stand by him, and to find that she was a “quitter,”
the thing he despised most on earth, hurt him. According
to his ideas, his own conduct in leaving
the yacht was not “quitting,” but frank piracy, a
thing which he by no means held in the same disesteem.</p>

<p>Bill’s arrival did not mend matters. Arriving at
the shore, his sailor’s eyes quickly missed the dinghy
that had trailed behind the sloop and he promptly
hired a shore boat and had himself rowed out.</p>

<p>As he came alongside, Tom, who had been watching
from below, came on deck to meet him, but
showed no interest in the success of his errand.</p>

<p>Bill, however, did not notice the other’s moodiness.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Tom,” he cried breathlessly. “It’s
all right. Everything’s fixed, and we’ll be off as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
soon as it gets dark. I had a d——d hard time of
it with them d——d nihilists on one side and the
cops on the other. But I pulled it off at last. Where’s
the liquor! Let’s splice the main brace on the
strength of it.”</p>

<p>Without answering, Tom set out a bottle and
watched the other drink. But he himself took
nothing.</p>

<p>Such disrespect to the convenances roused Bill’s
indignation. “What in h——l’s the matter with
you?” he demanded. “Anybody’d think I’d brought
bad news ’stead of tellin’ you I’d pulled the thing
off.”</p>

<p>Still Tom did not answer, and the other stared at
him with growing suspicion. “Where’s the dinghy?”
he demanded suddenly. “And where’s that girl?”</p>

<p>Tom raised his heavy eyes. “Gone,” he responded
briefly. “She took the boat and vamosed some time
last night.”</p>

<p>“Gone! Gone!” Bill’s voice rose to a scream.
“Gone where? After the cops? I always knowed
it. I always told you she’d do us. The little hell
cat. D—— her——”</p>

<p>A pair of sinewy hands closed round his throat,
choking the words, and he felt himself shaken to and
fro like a rat.</p>

<p>“That’ll do, Bill Wilkins,” grated a voice that
he hardly recognized as his brother’s. “That’ll do.
Don’t you orthogrify a word agin her. She’s playin’
for her own hand, same’s we are. You keep your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
tongue off her.” With the last word the plainsman
hurled the other across the cabin.</p>

<p>Bill picked himself up slowly. He fingered his
throat, swallowed once or twice, and then came back
to where Tom stood glowering.</p>

<p>“All right,” he mumbled. “I won’t say nothing
against her. She’s an angel of light if you say so.
But I reckon she’s sold us out, and I guess the peelers
are coming for us right now. We’d better get a move
on—unless you’d sooner stay here and get pulled
so’s not to spoil her game.”</p>

<p>Tom quivered, but said nothing. Lifelong self-control
was again in the ascendency. He knew
the other was right, and he already repented his
fury of a moment before.</p>

<p>“All right, Bill!” he said, almost calmly. “You’re
right. Only don’t say nothing against her to me.
I’m too plumb sore to stand it just now. We’ll go
as soon as you say.”</p>

<p>“I say now. The <i>Haakon</i>—she’s the steamer I’ve
chartered—won’t be along till about dawn, but we’ve
got to get out in the bay and wait for her. That
little h—— —that is, them policeoffskis may be down
on us any bloomin’ minute. The water’s quiet, and
I guess we won’t swamp. Wait! Let’s look.”</p>

<p>The man broke off and ran up the ladder that led
to the deck and poked his head above the combings.
In a moment he turned, and Tom could see that his
face was pale under its tan.</p>

<p>“—— —— ——!” he raged. “They’re coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
now. A dozen boats are starting out. Quick! We
ain’t got a minute to lose.”</p>

<p>He vaulted up on the deck, followed by the plainsman.</p>

<p>“Here!” he yelled. “Get that anchor up. Quick!
Then help me with the mainsail.”</p>

<p>He darted forward and grasped the jib halliards.
The weight was almost too much for one man, but
necessity lent strength, and by the time the anchor
was on board the jib was up. Then the two men
tailed on to the mainsail halliards and the big sail
rose slowly to the peak.</p>

<p>“Make fast! Hurry! Them boats are getting
near.”</p>

<p>Leaving the halliards to his brother, Bill sprang
to the sheet, and drew aft the flapping sail, holding
it with one hand against the bits, and grasping the
helm with the other.</p>

<p>The sloop was moving now, slowly but surely.
Behind her pulsed a distant outcry, borne hoarsely
across the water. Bill glared backward over his
shoulder. “Shout! Shout! D—— you!” he cried.</p>

<p>Tom was by his side now, sheeting home the mainsail.
The sloop felt the added press, and with every
movement gathered way. But in the lee of the shore
the wind was light, and the boats, driven by sinewy
arms, were coming fast, relentlessly cutting down
the distance that intervened.</p>

<p>Bill glared back at them. “Shoot ’em, Tom,”
he cried. “Shoot ’em! Why don’t you shoot?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>A grim smile curved the plainsman’s lips. Erect
he stood, a revolver in either hand, balancing to
the swaying boat. “Too far yet,” he muttered. “I
ain’t got no cartridges to waste. This is only the
overturnity; we’ll need ’em all when the main show
begins. Besides, we’re holding even with them
now.”</p>

<p>Indubitably the sloop was holding its own. With
every foot she gained from the land, the breeze grew
stronger. Soon the strip of water between her and
the boats showed perceptibly larger and the hoarse
cries grew fainter.</p>

<p>Tom lowered his pistols. “I guess we’re all
right now,” he remarked comfortably.</p>

<p>Bill grunted. “All right as far as them boats
counts,” he agreed. “But they’ll have steam
launches and gunboats and torpedo-boats after us
mighty soon, and then where’ll we be?”</p>

<p>“We won’t be in no jail,” returned his brother
grimly. “I won’t, any way. I won’t be took. I
always expected to cash in with my boots on, and
I’m ready right now.”</p>

<p>“Same here—if I can’t help myself. But I reckon
we’ve got a chance yet. They’ll be expectin’ us to
run west and try to fetch Copenhagen, I reckon!
But we’ll fool ’em. If we can get out of sight, we’ll
run east and try to meet the <i>Haakon</i>. We’ve got
to go east, any way. If we ran out into the Baltic,
we’d swamp, sure, just as we would have the other
day.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">DRIVEN by twin propellers, the <i>Sea Spume</i>
raced westward, bearing happy souls released
from the suspense of the past month.
Caruth had found a wife; Professor Shishkin, a
daughter; Marie, a father and a husband; and freed
from the long strain of service to the cause, she had
learned for the first time how heavy the burden
had been.</p>

<p>With them were Bristow and Olga. The reporter’s
assignment to the Russian capital was nearly up,
and as it was madness for Olga to remain longer in
the same city with Baron Demidroff and the pretended
Princess Napraxine, he had decided to sail
with Caruth.</p>

<p>They were all going back to America, to the western
world, and they were all happy at the thought.
They would find complications awaiting them, they
knew. Olga, reported by the papers to have been
identified as the Princess Napraxine and to have
married Demidroff, must keep away from her old
home and her old friends. Shishkin, though he had
gained one daughter without losing the other, must
pass as childless in the evening of his life. Caruth
would have to satisfy the curious as to his somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
remarkable performances in Russia and Russian
waters. And he would have to raise that million
dollars.</p>

<p>One and all they had agreed to shield Florence,
both for her sake and for theirs. To betray her was
to risk drawing down upon themselves nihilist
vengeance for the failure of the expedition—a failure
that would assuredly be charged to her substitution
for Olga. Besides, in that critical moment at the
Embassy they had all tacitly agreed to keep silence
in regard to her identity.</p>

<p>None of them were quite certain as to the part she
had played, as to whether she had been a traitor, a
double traitor, or only a spy. Anyhow, as Caruth
put it: “All’s well that ends well. I’m not heaving
any stones. I’m living in a tolerable imitation of a
glass house myself.”</p>

<p>So, bearing happy souls, the yacht sped westward
into the night.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Running before the wind, the sloop bearing the
Wilkins brothers and their golden plunder fled eastward.
Until the sun set, it had beat to the west,
toward the far-off land of promise, but as soon as
darkness hid it from sight of the land, it had turned
toward St. Petersburg, and for half a dozen hours
had churned heavily onward.</p>

<p>Heavily laden, deep in the water, requiring constant
bailing even in that smooth, sheltered sea, it
made slow progress. Pursuers such as must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
questing the gulf for it would surely find it as soon
as day dawned. Let the rising sun once gleam on
its sails and the game would be lost.</p>

<p>To Bill Wilkins, seated at the tiller, managing the
boat with a consummate skill whose constant exercise
alone kept it afloat, the game seemed lost long before
the dawn. In vain through the night he had strained
his eyes for the signal lights by which the steamer
<i>Haakon</i> was to signify her presence and readiness
to ship the gold. Either she had passed unseen or
her captain’s heart had failed him. In any case
dependence was no longer to be placed on her.</p>

<p>What other hope remained? None that Bill
Wilkins could see. The eastward course, while it
probably deluded the pursuers and gave the sloop
a little longer lease on freedom, led to no safety.
Every mile took the fugitives nearer to a Russian
prison. Yet any course but an eastern one was but
to throw themselves into the arms of the pursuers
or to plunge inevitably to the bottom the moment
the stronger waves of the Baltic were encountered.
To Bill, it seemed that they were rats in a trap,
waiting till the captors came to take them out. If
he had been alone, he would long ago have surrendered,
hoping to win pardon by giving up the gold.</p>

<p>But he soon found that it was useless to talk of
terms to his brother. A mere hint in that direction
aroused in the plainsman a cold fury before which
the weaker man shrank.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean nothing, Tom,” he hastened to
declare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>The plainsman’s eyes flashed. “I hope you
didn’t,” he roared. “I hope there ain’t no cowards
or quitters in our family. I’ve staked on this here
play, and I’m going to see it through. If I can’t
get away with this gold, nobody shall. Understand
that, Bill Wilkins.”</p>

<p>“I understand, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Besides, I ain’t certain sure we’re done for yet.
We’ve missed the <i>Haakon</i>, but she ain’t the only
boat on the sea. If we can find a ship—any old
ship—before dawn, we’ve got a chance.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“How so? Great Lord! Ain’t you got no receptions
at all, Bill Wilkins? Ain’t we got money
enough to buy anything if we can once get a chance
to show it? You think any captain breathin’ would
refuse a million dollars in gold to take us aboard.
And once aboard, who’d catch us? Russia can’t
search every ship going out of the Baltic.”</p>

<p>A spark of hope sprang up in Bill’s bosom—but
only a spark. “I don’t know where all the ships
are,” he muttered. “There’d ought to be plenty all
about. This here gulf is usually just crawling with
ships. But there ain’t none passing to-night—and
the dawn’s breaking.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Captain Wilson stood on the bridge of the yacht,
peering into the darkness. All night he had kept
watch, unwilling to leave his post on deck as long as
Russian waters lapped around the vessel committed
to his care. When, with eight bells in the morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
watch, there came a lightening of the sky, he turned
to the first officer.</p>

<p>“The dawn’s breaking, Jackson,” he said, “and
I think I’ll turn in. We’ve got through the night
safe and that’s more’n I expected.”</p>

<p>“What did you think was due to happen, sir?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. I felt something brooding.
My mother was Scotch and had second sight, and
I can generally tell when something’s due to come
off. But I guess I missed it this time. There comes
the sun, and nothing’s doing.”</p>

<p>“Sail O!” The forward lookout had hailed.</p>

<p>“Where away?”</p>

<p>“Dead ahead, sir.”</p>

<p>Captain Wilson lifted his glasses and stared forward
across the brightening water. After a moment
he turned to his companion.</p>

<p>“Can you make her out?” he asked, in a curious
tone.</p>

<p>“Only a fishing boat, I should judge, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but behind her and abeam. Don’t you
see——”</p>

<p>“By the Lord! One, two, three, four steamers,
all heading for her. What’s it mean?”</p>

<p>“It means—the something that was due to happen.
Send for Mr. Caruth at once. Unless I miss my
guess that boat carries Wilkins and his gold!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>As the sun came, Wilkins notched the sloop’s
bowsprit into it. “There’s the sun,” he remarked
grimly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>Tom stood up, releasing the handle of the pump,
and peered forward under his hand.</p>

<p>“And there comes a steamer,” he exulted.</p>

<p>Bill had been staring around the horizon. “Yes,
—— ——her!” he cried. “There she comes—too
late. Look yonder.”</p>

<p>Tom looked, and counted just as the yacht’s
officer had done. “One! Two! Three! Four!
By God! They’re right after us! All right”—grimly.
“We’ll give ’em a run for their money.”</p>

<p>But Bill groaned. “Wot’s the use,” he whined.
“It’ll only make things worse. We ain’t got a
chance.” He rose, his nerveless hand dropped
away from the tiller, and the sloop yawed sharply
to port.</p>

<p>“You d——n cur!” Tom’s voice rang out.
“You d——n cur! Grab that thing again quick,
or, by God, you won’t live to go to no jail!” His
revolver emphasized the words.</p>

<p>Between the two terrors, Bill deferred to the
nearer. Once more his hand closed on the tiller,
and the sloop, recovering headway, swept onward.</p>

<p>“Straight for the steamer,” Tom ordered.</p>

<p>Bill laughed harshly. “A h——l of a lot of help
she’ll be to us!” he cried. “You darned fool, don’t
you see it’s the <i>Sea Spume</i>?”</p>

<p>“What?” Tom spun round. “So much the
better!” he cried. “We won’t need to waste no
time explaining. And she’ll save us even if we lose
the gold. That’s the kind of soft-headed fool that
man Caruth is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>The yacht was very near now—so near Tom
Wilkins could distinctly hear the sound of her engine-room
bells signalling “stop.” The Russian boats
were also near. Wilkins looked at them, then at the
yacht, then thrust his pistols back into his belt.</p>

<p>“They won’t shoot,” he declared. “We’re too
valuable to shoot. And I guess you’re right. We
can’t whip a whole fleet, but we’ll spoil their game,
all the same.” He paused and glanced at the yacht.
“Run across her bows,” he ordered, “and float
down alongside.”</p>

<p>Little margin was there, but the sloop took what
there was and swept across just ahead of the yacht’s
sharp prow.</p>

<p>As she scraped aft, screened for a moment from
the sight of the Russians, Wilkins caught his brother’s
arms, and hoisted the slighter man upward toward
the yacht’s shrouds. “Grab hold! Quick!” he
directed.</p>

<p>As Bill scrambled upward, the plainsman sprang
upon the further gunwale of the sloop and leaned
far outward. Borne down by his weight, the overloaded
boat careened; a green wave curled in over
her side; and quietly and soberly she went down
beneath his feet.</p>

<p>As he felt her go down, Tom turned to the
yacht, and waved his hand. “Heave us a rope,
Mr. Caruth,” he called. “I can’t swim!”</p>

<p>Caruth did not hesitate. He had read the plainsman’s
purpose and had given orders accordingly.
In less than a minute Tom Wilkins, dripping but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
unhurt, stood on the deck beside his brother Bill,
while aft, in the water churned into foam by the
screws of the yacht, a white sail fluttered for a
moment; then was gone.</p>

<p>Caruth looked at the spot where the sloop had
disappeared; then at the plainsman; then at the
hurrying Russians. “That was a child’s trick,
Wilkins,” he said severely. “The water isn’t fifty
feet deep here, and Demidroff can fish the gold up
easy. Meanwhile, you’ve put us all in a hole.”</p>

<p>“Not much I ain’t. Look!”</p>

<p>Caruth looked again. The yacht was drawing
rapidly away, and the Russians were making no
effort to follow her. Clustered around the spot
where the sloop sank, they seemed to be throwing
out buoys to mark the spot.</p>

<p>And the yacht swept westward.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Six months later, five of the chief participants
in the contest for the <i>Orkney’s</i> gold were gathered
at a home dinner given by the Caruths to mark their
departure from the apartment in the Chimneystack
Building to the splendid new house Caruth had
bought for his bride. Until then, Marie had insisted
on remaining in the rooms where she had first met
her husband.</p>

<p>Inevitably, as always when these five met, the
talk turned on the trip of the <i>Sea Spume</i> and those
connected with the quest for the <i>Orkney’s</i> gold.</p>

<p>Caruth opened the subject. Said he:</p>

<p>“I got a letter from Colorado from the Wilkinses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
to-day. They’ve struck a gold mine that Tom
Wilkins says is going to make them all rich if they
can get the money to develop it. He offers to sell
me a share on easy terms. He certainly has more
assurance than anybody I ever knew.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know.” It was Bristow who spoke.
“He was within his rights, you know, in that matter
of the <i>Orkney</i>. Irrespective of his part in sinking
the <i>Orkney</i>, Bill Wilkins saved that gold from the
abandoned wreck, and thereby got a perfect title
to about nine-tenths of it by the laws of pretty nearly
every country in the world. Russia had no right
to take it from him, and he would have had a good
claim against her at the end if Tom Wilkins hadn’t
wrecked and abandoned it again. That gave the
second salvors their claim and wiped out his.”</p>

<p>Caruth growled. “He’d have had a hard time
making good,” he observed. “Demidroff didn’t
fish that gold up from the bottom of the gulf to surrender
it to the Wilkinses.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I’m only discussing the legal rights
of the matter, and Tom Wilkins’s part in it. If Bill
Wilkins owned the gold—as he did—he had a right to
take any partners in he liked. Oh, yes, the Wilkinses
were within their legal rights all the time, though
that isn’t exactly a recommendation for going in
with them on a gold mine. There are too many
legal robberies connected with that class of property
to suit me.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid there is too much law in this country,”
chimed in Marie. “Just as there is too little in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
Russia. But what have you heard of the progress
of the suit of the Princess Napraxine against Count
Strogoff, Mr. Bristow?”</p>

<p>Bristow glanced quickly at his wife. “The Princess
really seems about to win,” he declared, “though
the case is still in the courts. Our man there writes
me that he understands the Czar is convinced that
the claim is valid, and has received the ‘Princess’
officially at his court. That means that everything’s
over except the shouting. I don’t know; sometimes
I wonder if I did right in letting Olga give up everything!”</p>

<p>But Olga smiled. “Not for me,” she declared, as
she had declared in Baron Demidroff’s presence six
months before. “Not for me. I told Baron Demidroff
the truth. My tastes are simple, and I am quite
content without the millions and the rank.”</p>

<p>“And in any event you are right.” It was Marie
who spoke. “I have tested that mode of life, and I
know. There is nothing in its glitter and pomp to
balance home—home such as I never had and never
could have had in Russia’s splendid barbarism.
No, no, Mr. Bristow! If Olga had hesitated, it
would have been your duty to tear her away from
it by force. The world has nothing to offer that is
better than America and American husbands.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are quite right!” The Professor smiled
benignantly on his two daughters. “You are quite
right, both of you! Money and rank! What are
they? Nothing! Nothing to freedom and the
chance for a man to be a man! Besides,” he added<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
shrewdly, “I suspect those estates will not be so
very large after all. If Strogoff has not plundered
them, he is not the man he is reputed to be.”</p>

<p>The bell at the door of the apartment rang, and
a moment later a servant brought an evening paper
to Caruth.</p>

<p>“The janitor brought this up, sir,” he explained.
“He says as how there’s something in it he thinks
you’ll like to see, sir.”</p>

<p>Caruth took the paper and glanced down its
columns. Then he uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” he cried. “Listen to this dispatch
from St. Petersburg:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A tragic sequel to the suit of the Princess Yves Napraxine
against Count Strogoff for the possession of her ancestral
estates took place here to-day. Both the Princess and her husband,
Baron Demidroff, for fifteen years chief at the dreaded
third section of the Russian police, were instantly killed this
morning by a bomb thrown by a man who was mortally
wounded by the guard as he tried to flee. Before he died, he
confessed that he had acted at the instigation of Count Strogoff.
Officers were at once sent to arrest the Count, but he had learned
somehow that his complicity was known and blew out his brains
as they came in at the door. The estates of the Princess, whose
romantic story has become well known to the world in the past
year, will now revert to the Crown. It is rumored that they have
been shamelessly plundered, and instead of being at colossal
value are really almost worthless.”</p>
</div>

<p>Caruth dropped the paper. “There’s more of
it,” he finished, “but that’s the substance.”</p>

<p>Olga clasped her hands. “Oh, Joe, Joe!” she
cried. “It might have been you and me! It might
have been you and me!”</p>

<p>What do you know of the Sargasso Sea—that
wonderful floating island of seaweed in the Atlantic
Ocean, directly in the path of every steamer sailing
from the Gulf of Mexico to Europe?</p>

<p>This story tells how three shipwrecked passengers,
two men and a charming young woman, got drawn
into the Sargasso Sea, where they found an entire fleet
of vessels, that had been similarly caught by the
revolving current, and had been there, some of them,
since the days of the Spaniards. It is all so vivid
that one can see the gaunt wrecks, the flapping sails,
the marvellous lost galleons of Spain. The experiences
of these three, until they are rescued, make a
story whose interest never flags even for an instant.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p class="drop-cap">HERE is a tale indeed—big and forceful, palpitating with
interest, and written with the sureness of touch and the
breadth of a man who is master of his art. Mr. Comfort
has drawn upon two practically new story-places in the world of
fiction to furnish the scenes for his narrative—India and Manchuria
at the time of the Russo-Japanese War. While the novel is distinguished
by its clear and vigorous war scenes, the fine and sweet
romance of the love of the hero, Routledge—a brave, strange,
and talented American—for the “most beautiful woman in London”
rivals these in interest.</p>

<p>The story opens in London, sweeps up and down Asia, and
reaches its most rousing pitch on the ghastly field of Liaoyang, in
Manchuria. The one-hundred-mile race from the field to a free
cable outside the war zone, between Routledge and an English
war correspondent, is as exciting and enthralling as anything that
has appeared in fiction in recent years.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p>“A big, vital, forceful story that towers giant-high—a romance to lure the
hours away in tense interest—book with a message for all mankind.”</p>

<p class="right">—<i>Detroit Free Press.</i></p>

<p>“Three such magnificent figures as Routledge, Noreen and Rawder never
before have appeared together in fiction. Take it all in all, ‘Routledge Rides
Alone’ is a great novel, full of sublime conception, one of the few novels that
are as ladders from heaven to earth.”</p>

<p class="right">—<i>San Francisco Argonaut.</i></p>

<p>“The story unfolds a vast and vivid panorama of life. The first chapters
remind one strongly of the descriptive Kipling we once knew. We commend the
book for its sustained interest. We recommend it for its descriptive power.”</p>

<p class="right">—<i>Boston Evening Transcript.</i></p>

<p>“Here is one of the strangest novels of the year; a happy blending of
romance and realism, vivid, imaginative, dramatic, and, above all, a well told story
with a purpose. It is a red-blooded story of war and love, with a touch of the
mysticism of India, some world politics, love of country, and hate of oppression—a
tale of clean and expert workmanship, powerful and personal.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">A remarkable novel, full of vital force, which gives us
a glimpse into the innermost sanctuary of a woman’s
soul—a revelation of the truth that to a woman there may
be a greater thing than the love of a man—the story pictured
against a wonderful Southern California background.</p>

<p>“One of the big headliners in bookland.”—<i>Detroit News.</i></p>

<p>“The book is a tissue of mysteries, quite apart from the ordinary
usages, but solved in the end satisfactorily.”—<i>Chicago Tribune.</i></p>

<p>“One of those rare examples of literary composition the artistic
excellence of which is uniform and even throughout.”—<i>Charleston News and Courier.</i></p>

<p>“There is color, vitality, and freshness in the picture, and
charming variety of detail in the development of story. Horton
is the ideal lover, strong-hearted, wilful, persevering; and Kate
is the vivid, tantalizing, impersonal creature in an armor of secrecy.
But the author transforms this woman into a being of rarest and
most beautiful human qualities—or rather, brings those latent emotions
to the fore. She is a woman racked by grief over death and
unhappy marital experiences in youth, and, later, a woman ‘lied
to, tortured, duped, and her heart polluted and desecrated’; and
in giving up her beloved lawyer-friend, whom she would have
married, to the ‘helpless, motherless, hampered’ child who so
passionately claimed his love, Kate’s humanism stands out in almost
supernatural power.”—<i>Boston Evening Transcript.</i></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
